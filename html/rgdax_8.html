<h2>Get Hold Details for An Account Using Currency</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is an auth based function. User must have valid api keys generated by GDAX which must be passed as mandatory arguments. The function takes a currency as an additional input and returns the hold information. Since currency and account id have one to one mapping, the currency is being used a proxy. The basic hold amounts can also be fetched using <code>account</code> or <code>accounts</code>, however this function provides additional details and ties to active open orders. Please note that each trade buy order, results in a hold on the currency like <code>USD</code> and each sell order will result in a hold on the cryptoasset like <code>BTC</code>.
