<h2>Removes unused MARK output files</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Identifies all unused (orphaned) mark*.inp, .vcv, .res and .out and .tmp
files in the working directory and removes them.  The orphaned files are
determined by examining all mark objects and lists of mark objects (created
by <code>collect.models</code>) to create a list of files in use. All other
files are treated as orphans to delete.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cleanup(lx = NULL, ask = TRUE, prefix = "mark")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lx</code></td>
<td>
<p>listing of R objects; defaults to list of workspace from calling
environment; if NULL it uses ls(envir=parent.frame())</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ask</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE, prompt whether each file should be removed. Typically
will be used with ask=FALSE but default of TRUE may avoid problems</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prefix</code></td>
<td>
<p>prefix for filename if different than "mark"</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function removes orphaned output files from MARK.  This occurs when
there are output files in the subdirectory that are not associated with a
mark object in the current R session (.Rdata). For example, if you repeat an
analysis or set of analyses and store them in the same object then the
original set of output files would no longer be linked to an R object and
would be orphaned.
</p>
<p>As an example, consider the <code>mallard</code> analysis. The first time
you run the analysis script in an empty subdirectory it would create 9 sets
of MARK output files (mark001.out,.vcv,.res,.inp to
mark009.out,.vcv,.res,.inp) and each would be linked to one of the objects
in <code>nest.results</code>. When the command
<code>AgePpnGrass=nest.results$AgePpnGrass</code> was issued, both of those
<code>mark</code> objects were linked to the same set of output files.  Now if you
were to repeat the above commands and re-run the models and stored the
results into <code>nest.results</code> again, it would create files with prefixes
10 to 18. Because that would have replaced <code>nest.results</code>, none of the
files numbered 1 to 9 would be linked to an object.
<code>cleanup(ask=FALSE)</code> automatically removes those orphan files.  If you
delete all objects in the R session with the command
<code>rm(list=ls(all=TRUE))</code>, then subsequently <code>cleanup(ask=FALSE)</code>
will delete all MARK output files because all of them will be orphans.
Output files can also become orphans if MARK finishes but for some reason R
crashes or you forget to save your session before you exit R.  Orphan output
files can be re-linked to an R object without re-running MARK by re-running
the <code>mark</code> function in R and specifing the <code>filename</code>
argument to match the base portion of the orphaned output file (eg
"mark067").  It will create all of the necessary R objects and then asks if
you want to use the existing file.  If you respond affirmatively it will
link to the orphaned files.
