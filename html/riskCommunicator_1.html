<h2>A subset of the <code>framingham</code> teaching data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A subset of the <code>framingham</code> teaching dataset containing the following changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>removal of all observations where PERIOD == 2 or PERIOD == 3 (i.e. keep only PERIOD == 1)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>removal of all observations where PREVCHD == 1 (i.e. all patients with coronary heart disease at baseline)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>created a new variable, <code>cvd_dth</code> signifying an outcome of cardiovascular disease OR death (i.e. if the patient had either CVD or DEATH, this new variable is 1, otherwise 0)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>created a new variable, <code>timeout</code>, which calculates the number of days from the start of the study to cardiovascular disease, death, or loss to follow-up
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>created a new variable, <code>logpdays</code>, which is the log of <code>timeout</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>created a new variable, <code>nhosp</code>, which is a simulated number of hospitalizations
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of 
Health developed a longitudinal, epidemiology-focused dataset using the Framingham 
Heart Study. The Framingham Heart Study is a long term prospective study of the 
etiology of cardiovascular disease among a population of free living subjects in 
the community of Framingham, Massachusetts. The Framingham Heart Study was a 
landmark study in epidemiology in that it was the first prospective study of 
cardiovascular disease and identified the concept of risk factors and their joint 
effects. The study began in 1948 and 5,209 subjects were initially enrolled in the 
study. Participants have been examined biennially since the inception of the study 
and all subjects are continuously followed through regular surveillance for 
cardiovascular outcomes. Clinic examination data has included cardiovascular disease 
risk factors and markers of disease such as blood pressure, blood chemistry, lung 
function, smoking history, health behaviors, ECG tracings, Echocardiography, and 
medication use. Through regular surveillance of area hospitals, participant contact, 
and death certificates, the Framingham Heart Study reviews and adjudicates events for 
the occurrence of Angina Pectoris, Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, and 
Cerebrovascular disease. This dataset contains three clinic examinations and 20 year 
follow-up data on a large subset of the original Framingham cohort participants.
</p>
<p>NOTE: This is a "teaching" dataset. Specific methods were employed to ensure an 
anonymous dataset that protects patient confidentiality; therefore, this dataset is 
inappropriate for publication purposes." The use of these data for the purposes of 
this package were approved on 11Mar2019 (request #7161) by NIH/NHLBI.
