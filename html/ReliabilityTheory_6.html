<h2>Compute the survival signature of a system</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The system survival signature (Coolen and Coolen-Maturi, 2012) is a generalisation of the signature to systems with multiple component types.  This function automatically computes the survival signature of the specified system.  Here, system implies components (as opposed to links) are unreliable.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">computeSystemSurvivalSignature(sys, cutsets=NULL, frac=FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sys</code></td>
<td>

<p>a <code>system</code> object representing the system whose types are to be set.  This should have been created by a call to <code>createSystem</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cutsets</code></td>
<td>

<p>if the cut-sets of the system or network are already known they may be passed in as a list of numeric vectors.  This can save time because cut-set computation is the slowest part of the algorithm.  Leaving as NULL causes the function to find the cut sets itself.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>frac</code></td>
<td>

<p>if TRUE then the function prints out survival signature probabilities as fractions rather than decimals.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The survival signature of a system with <code class="reqn">K</code> types of component is the functional <code class="reqn">\Phi(l_1, \dots, l_K)</code> giving the probability that the system works given exactly <code class="reqn">l_k</code> of the components of type <code class="reqn">k</code> are working.  See Coolen and Coolen-Maturi (2012) for details.  Thus, the survival signature can be represented by a table with <code class="reqn">K+1</code> columns, the first <code class="reqn">K</code> being the number of each type of component which is working and the final column being the probability the system works.
</p>
<p>The system or network is specified by means of a <code>system</code> object, whereby each end of the system is denoted by nodes named <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> which are taken to be perfectly reliable.  It is easy to construct the appropriate reliability block diagram representation using the function <code>createSystem</code>.  Note that each physically distinct component should be separately numbered when constructing this object.
</p>
<p>Once the topology of the system has been defined (or at definition time), one must indicate the type of each component (if not done when initially calling <code>createSystem</code> it can later be modified using <code>setCompTypes</code>).  The Examples section below features the full computation of the survival signature for Figure 1 in Coolen and Coolen-Maturi (2012) and Figure 2 in Coolen <em>et al</em> (2013) to make this clear.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>computeSystemSurvivalSignature</code> returns a data frame with <code class="reqn">K+1</code> columns.  The first <code class="reqn">K</code> columns represent the function inputs, <code class="reqn">l_1, \dots, l_K</code> and the final column is the probability that the system works given the corresponding numbers of each component which are working.
