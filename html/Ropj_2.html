<h2>Parse Origin(R) project file into a list of objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function parses an OPJ file into a list of objects it consists
of. Items understood by <code>read.opj</code> include spreadsheets, matrices,
and notes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  read.opj(file, encoding = 'latin1', tree = FALSE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file</code></td>
<td>

<p>Path to the OPJ file to parse. Only file paths are supported,
not R connections. Path is not expanded automatically.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>encoding</code></td>
<td>

<p>Encoding of the strings inside the file being opened. This should
correspond to the ANSI code page of Windows installation used to
produce the file. The default of <code>'latin1'</code> is usually safe to
use. See <code>iconvlist()</code> for the full list of encodings
supported by your R installation.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tree</code></td>
<td>

<p>Control the structure of the returned list. When <code>FALSE</code>
(default), returned list is flat and its unique names correspond
to the short names of the objects, while the <code>comment</code>
attribute contains their long names and comments. When <code>TRUE</code>,
the list itself becomes a recursive data structure containing the
tree of the objects, making it possible to access objects by their
paths in that tree.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>The rest of the arguments is passed to <code>as.data.frame</code>
when converting spreadsheets from lists of columns, making it possible
to set <code>stringsAsFactors</code> and other parameters as needed.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A named <code>list</code> containing objects stored in the file.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Spreadsheets are presented as <code>data.frame</code>s,
with additional <code>attributes</code>:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>comment</code> contains the fields Long name, Units,
and Comment, joined by <code>\r\n</code>, if present.  Due to a
possible bug in <code>liborigin</code>, these values are sometimes
followed by <code>@</code> and some text that wasn't present in
the original document. (In versions prior to v0.2-2 it was called
<code>comments</code>, which should be still supported until v1.0.)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>commands</code> contains the formula that was used to
create the values of the column (e.g. <code>col(A) * 2 + 1</code>).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p> Multi-sheet spreadsheets are stored as named lists of
<code>data.frame</code>s described above.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Matrices are presented as <code>list</code>s
of <code>matrix</code> objects containing numeric
data. <code>dimnames</code> are also assigned.  The list also
has attributes:
</p>

<ul><li> <p><code>commands</code> contains the formula that was used to
compute the values in the matrix.
</p>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<p> Notes are stored as plain strings.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When <code>tree = FALSE</code>, the list is flat, its names are short names
of the objects, and the <code>comment</code> attribute of the list
contains the long names of the objects
stored in the file.
</p>
<p>When <code>tree = TRUE</code>, the list names are long names (if present;
short otherwise) and the list itself represents the folder structure
of the project.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>While Origin(R) and its scripting language seem to rely on the
<em>short</em> names of the objects being unique across a project,
neither <em>long</em> names nor <em>folder</em> names are guaranteed to
avoid collisions. Tree-like lists returned by <code>read.opj(..., tree =
  TRUE)</code> might be easier to navigate interactively but present problems
if someone gives multiple folders or objects the same long name.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  x &lt;- read.opj(system.file('test.opj', package = 'Ropj'))
  head(x$Book2, 7)
  comment(x$Book2)
  attr(x$Book2, 'commands')
  with(x$Book1, head(Sheet2 - Sheet1))
  x$MBook1$MSheet1[1:4,1:4]
  x$Note1

  if ('CP1251' %in% iconvlist()) {
    # encoding names aren't guaranteed to be supported across all platforms
    x &lt;- read.opj(system.file('test.opj', package = 'Ropj'), 'CP1251')
    print(x$cyrillic)
  }

  str(read.opj(system.file('tree.opj', package = 'Ropj'), tree = TRUE))
</code></pre>
