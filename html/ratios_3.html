<h2>Correction.AdheringParticles</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Suppose element data of one data set (DT1) are biased because the concentrations are the result of a mixture of two substances, of which one substance are the element concentrations of DT2.
In order to correct DT1 to <code class="reqn">DT_{corrected}</code> a fraction of DT2 has to be subtracted from DT1.
The basic equation for the correction is:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
DT_{corrected}=\frac{DT1 - x * DT2}{1 - x}
</code>
</p>

<p>whereof <em>x</em> is the amount of DT2 to be subtracted.
</p>
<p>The function is written for the case that <em>x</em> is unknown.
To calculate <em>x</em> the condition is that in <code class="reqn">DT_{corrected}</code> at least one element concentration is zero or known.
Suppose <code class="reqn">vars_{i}</code> has a very low concentration, close to zero, in <code class="reqn">DT_{corrected}</code>: <code class="reqn">DT_{corrected}[vars_{i}]=0</code>, then:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
x =  \frac{DT1[vars_{i}]}{DT2[vars_{i}]}
</code>
</p>

<p>The function was developed for the use to correct plant concentrations for adhering particles:
Exact and reproducible analysis of element concentrations in plant tissue is the basis for many research fields such as environmental, health, phytomining, agricultural or provenance studies.
Unfortunately plant samples collected in the field will always contain particles on their tissue surfaces such as airborne dust or soil particles.
If not removed these particles may induce a bias to the element concentrations measured in plant samples.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The main option of this function is the <code>method</code> which determines how the amount of DT2 to be subtracted, the <em>x</em>, is going to be calculated.
There are four options:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Method 1: calculate <em>x</em> via a fixed element
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Method 2: calculate <em>x</em> via the element with the smallest ratio between DT1[vars] and DT2[vars]
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Method 3: calculate <em>x</em> via the median of several, very small ratios between DT1[vars] and DT2[vars]
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Method subtr: calculate the concentrations for <code class="reqn">x * DT2[vars]</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To Method 1:
For example using Ti as <code>element</code> <code class="reqn">DT_{corrected}</code> is calculated with <code class="reqn"> x = DT1[Ti]/DT2[Ti]</code>.
Typical elements for the option <code>element</code> are e.g. Ti, Al, Zr, Sc, ...
This will eventually lead to negative concentrations for some elements.
</p>
<p>To Method 2:
This method subtracts the smallest possible content of DT2 from DT1 (smallest <em>x</em>).
For each row/sample the element with the smallest <em>x</em> of all ratios <code class="reqn"> x = DT1[vars]/DT2[vars]</code> of each sample is taken as <em>element</em>,
hence every sample is corrected based on a different <em>element</em>.
With this method there are no negative concentrations.
</p>
<p>To Method 3:
In order to reduce the uncertainty of the content of DT2 in DT1 (<em>x</em>) based on only one element as in method 1 and 2 an average of several <em>x</em> of elements can be calculated.
With <code class="reqn">\Delta x</code> being the absolute error of <em>x</em> the median is calculated by all <em>x</em> of elements which values <code class="reqn"> x - \Delta x</code> are smaller than <code class="reqn"> x_{smallest} + \Delta x_{smallest}</code>.
The value of the median <code class="reqn">\bar{x}</code> is then used as <em>x</em>.
This will eventually lead to negative concentrations for some elements.
Because statistically the <em>x</em> of all elements, which error overlaps the error of the element with smallest <em>x</em>, are indistinguishable we suggest to set all elements contributing to <code class="reqn">\bar{x}</code> to zero, because these small values should not be interpreted:
Set option <code>set_statistical_0</code> to TRUE.
</p>
<p>It is advisable to exclude elements with a huge error margin in the option <code>vars_ignore</code> because they could severely increase the median <code class="reqn">\bar{x}</code> by "opening" the window of error-ranges for many elements with significantly higher ratios.
This could lead to an unnatural high median <code class="reqn">\bar{x}</code> resulting into an overcorrection.
</p>
<p>If option <code>id.vars</code> is provided the functions prints the 'group1.vars' and 'id.vars' of the sample.
