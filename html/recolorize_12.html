<h2>Generate a 'coldist' object for CIE Lab colors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A stopgap function for generating a pavo::coldist object
from CIE Lab colors. This a pretty serious abstraction of the
original intention of a <code>coldist</code> object, which is to use
a combination of spectra data, visual model, and/or receptor-noise
model to calculate perceived chromatic and achromatic distances
between colors. Because CIE Lab color space is an approximately
perceptually uniform color space for human vision, we can calculate
a version of those distances for a human viewer directly from
CIE Lab. A decent option if you want preliminary results,
if you only care about human perception, or if you don't have access
to spectral data.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cielab_coldist(rgbcols)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rgbcols</code></td>
<td>
<p>An nx3 matrix of RGB colors (rows are colors and
columns are R, G, and B channels).</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>I have mixed feelings about this function and would like to
replace it with something a little less hand-wavey.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A pavo::coldist object with four columns: the patches
being contrasted (columns 1-2), the chromatic contrast (<code>dS</code>),
and the achromatic contrast (<code>dL</code>), all in units of Euclidean
distance in CIE Lab space.
