<h2>
Obtain sequences for BE study designs
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function is intended as helper function to get the sequences for commonly 
used designs in BE studies.<br> 
These sequences may then subsequently used in function <code>RL4()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sequences(design, tmts = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>design</code></td>
<td>

<p>A character value describing the study design. For crossover studies it is
"tmts x sequences x periods" without space.<br>
F.i. "2x2x2" is the standard 2-treatments-2-sequence-2-period crossover.<br>
The designs <code>"2x2x2", "3x3x3", "4x4x4"</code> may be abbreviated to 
<code>"2x2", "3x3", "4x4"</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tmts</code></td>
<td>

<p>A character vector with the codes of the treatments.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function was implemented because I couldn't remember f.i. all the six 
sequences of a "3x6x3" design if had to be coded by T1,T2 and R.<br>
The sequences are primarily build within the ABC... notation.<br>
If treatment codes are given the "AB..." in the sequences are replaced by these codes.<br><br>
The following designs are implemented:<br><code>"parallel"</code> = 2-group parallel design<br><code>"2x2"</code> = classical 2-treatments-2-sequence-2-period crossover<br><code>"3x3"</code> = 3-treatments-3-sequence-3-period crossover (Latin square)<br><code>"3x6x3"</code> = 3-treatments-6-sequence-3-period crossover (Williams design)<br><code>"4x4"</code> = 4-treatments-4-sequence-4-period crossover (Latin square)<br><code>"2x2x3"</code> = 2-sequence-3-period replicate crossover<br><code>"2x2x4"</code> = 2-sequence-4-period full replicate crossover<br><code>"2x4x4"</code> = 4-sequence-4-period full replicate crossover<br><code>"2x3x3"</code> = 3-sequence-3-period partial (reference) replicate crossover<br><code>"2x4x2"</code> = 4-sequence-2-period replicate crossover, Baalams design.<br><br>
The sequences for the <code>"3x3"</code> and <code>"4x4"</code> designs are randomly derived 
from the standard Latin squares (in ABC notation)<br><code>ABC, BCA, CAB</code><br>
or in case of the <code>"4x4"</code> design from <br><code>ABCD, BDAC, CADB, DCBA</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a character vector with the sequences.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>For the higher order designs (designs with more than 2 treatments or replicate
crossover designs, respectively) only a selection of possible designs are covered.<br>
The design sequences for <code>"4x4"</code> are not guaranteed to be a Williams design.
If need a Williams design use function <code>williams()</code> instead.
