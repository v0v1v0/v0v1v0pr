<h2>Black duck known fate data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A known fate data set on Black ducks that accompanies MARK as an example
analysis using the Known model.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 48 observations on the following 5 variables.
</p>
 <dl>
<dt>ch</dt>
<dd>
<p>a character vector containing the encounter history of
each bird</p>
</dd> <dt>BirdAge</dt>
<dd>
<p>the age of the bird: a factor with levels <code>0</code>
<code>1</code> for young and adult</p>
</dd> <dt>Weight</dt>
<dd>
<p>the weight of the bird at time
of marking</p>
</dd> <dt>Wing_Len</dt>
<dd>
<p>the wing-length of the bird at time of marking</p>
</dd>
<dt>condix</dt>
<dd>
<p>the condition index of the bird at time of marking</p>
</dd> </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is a data set that accompanies program MARK as an example for Known
fate. The data can be stratified using BirdAge as a grouping variable.  The
function <code>run.Blackduck</code> defined below in the examples creates some of
the models used in the dbf file that accompanies MARK.
</p>
<p>Note that in the MARK example the variable is named Age.  In the R code, the
fields "age" and "Age" have specific meanings in the design data related to
time since release.  These will override the use of a field with the same
name in the individual covariate data, so the names "time", "Time",
"cohort", "Cohort", "age", and "Age" should not be used in the individual
covariate data with possibly the exception of "cohort" which is not defined
for models with "Square" PIMS such as POPAN and other Jolly-Seber type
models.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
data(Blackduck)
# Change BirdAge to numeric; starting with version 1.6.3 factor variables are
# no longer allowed.  They can work as in this example but they can be misleading
# and fail if the levels are non-numeric.  The real parameters will remain 
# unchanged but the betas will be different.

# estimates are the same.
