<h2>rcarbon:Calibration and analysis of radiocarbon dates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">rcarbon</span> package handles the calibration and analysis of radiocarbon, often but not exclusively for the purposes of archaeological research. It includes functions not only for basic calibration, uncalibration and plotting of one or more dates, but also a statistical framework for building demographic and related longitudinal inferences from aggregate radiocarbon date lists.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Core functions in the <span class="pkg">rcarbon</span> package can be grouped as follows:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Calibration Functions</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><code>calibrate</code> and <code>uncalibrate</code> enable the calibration and back-calibration for a variety of curves.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Aggregation Functions</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><code>spd</code> generates a summed probability distribution (SPD) of radiocarbon dates; <code>binPrep</code> can be used to define clusters of radiocarbon dates associated with the same context/phase</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Statistical Test Functions</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><code>modelTest</code> compares the observed SPD against a variety of theoretical models (most typically an exponential curve) using the Monte-Carlo approach; <code>p2pTest</code> compares observed differences in SPD between two user-specified points in time against differences expected from a theoretical model; <code>permTest</code> compares two or more SPDs and test for the null hypothesis that all sets are derived from the same population; <code>sptest</code> identifies, for defined intervals, locations with significantly higher or lower growth rate in the SPD compared to the pan-regional trend in the data</p>
</dd>
</dl>
