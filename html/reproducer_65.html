<h2>KitchenhamMadeyskiBrereton.ABBAMetaAnalysisReportedResults data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data is used in the paper: Barbara Kitchenham, Lech Madeyski and Pearl Brereton. Meta-analysis for Families of Experiments: A Systematic Review and Reproducibility Assessment, Empirical Software Engineering (2019) doi:10.1007/s10664-019-09747-0.
This data set reports the meta-analysis results reported by the authors of the primary studies included in the systematic review that reported results on a per document basis which for S7 and S11 was equivalent to reporting the results for each time period.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A text file with variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Study</dt>
<dd>
<p>This field includes the study identifier of each of the the 3 primary studies which reported results per document.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Type</dt>
<dd>
<p>This identifies the type of effect size used by the study authors. d or g refer to d_IG and g_IG, P is the aggregated p values, if the repeated measures (RM) estimate was obtained it is appropriately specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>
<p>Always set to Rep. This identifies that the data was as reported by the primary study authors.</p>
</dd>
<dt>mean</dt>
<dd>
<p>The overall mean effect size reported by the study authors</p>
</dd>
<dt>pvalue</dt>
<dd>
<p>The one-sided p-value associated with the overall mean reported by the study authors. NA means the authors did not report this statistic.</p>
</dd>
<dt>UB</dt>
<dd>
<p>The upper bound of the confidence interval of the overall mean as reported by the primary study authors. NA means the authors did not report this statistic.</p>
</dd>
<dt>LB</dt>
<dd>
<p>The lower bound of the confidence interval of the overall mean as reported by the primary study authors. NA means the authors did not report this statistic.</p>
</dd>
<dt>QE</dt>
<dd>
<p>The heterogeneity statistic associated with the meta-analysis as reported by the study authors. NA means the authors did not report this statistic.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Qep</dt>
<dd>
<p>The p-value of the heterogeneity statistic associated with the meta-analysis as reported by the study authors. NA means the authors did not report this statistic.</p>
</dd>
