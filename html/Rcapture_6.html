<h2>  Lazuli Bunting Data </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set contains frequencies of capture histories for 8 years of observation of lazuli buntings. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bunting</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>255 by 9 numeric matrix, with the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>p1</code>, <code>p2</code>, <code>p3</code>, <code>p4</code>, <code>p5</code>, <code>p6</code>, <code>p7</code>, <code>p8</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p> Capture histories from eight periods</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>freq</code></dt>
<dd>
<p> Observed frequencies for each capture history</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data come from an eight-year (1973 to 1980) study by Allen W. Stokes of lazuli buntings wintering in Logan, Utah. 
This data set is analyzed in Burnham and al. (1987) and in Cormack (1993).
</p>
<p>Each row of this data set represents an observed capture history followed by its frequency.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">descriptive(bunting, dfreq = TRUE)
  # 1430 birds among the 1681 birds seen (85%) were caught only once. 
  # This suggests the presence of transient birds at each capture occasion.

op.m1$model.fit
plot(op.m1)
  # The residuals plot shows large residuals for the birds caught twice or
  # more while the residuals are small for birds caught once. The Jolly-Seber 
  # model does not fit well and the likely presence of transients might 
  # cause that. Let's remove the birds caught only once from the analysis.

op.m2&lt;- openp(bunting, dfreq = TRUE, keep = keep2)
op.m2$model.fit
  # The deviance drop of 94 for 6 degrees of freedom is highly significant.
plot(op.m2)
  # The residual plot still shows Pearson residuals larger than 4. We redo
  # the analysis without the transient birds and without the large residuals.

keep3p &lt;- residuals(op.m2$glm, type = "pearson") &lt; 4

  # These changes have little impact on the survival estimates. 

  # We now test the equality of the survival probabilities and estimate its

se &lt;- 1 / sqrt(t(rep(1, 5)) %*% siginv %*% rep(1, 5))
cbind(estimate = phi, stderr = se)
  # The chi-square goodness of fit statistic for a constant survival 
  # and its pvalue are:
chisq4 &lt;- t(op.m2$survivals[2:6, 1] - as.vector(phi)) %*% siginv %*%
