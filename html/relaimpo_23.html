<h2> Package to calculate relative importance metrics for linear models  </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">relaimpo</span> calculates several relative importance metrics for the linear model. 
The recommended metrics are <code>lmg</code> (<code class="reqn">R^2</code> partitioned by averaging over orders, like in Lindemann, Merenda and Gold (1980, p.119ff)) 
and <code>pmvd</code> (a newly proposed metric by Feldman (2005), non-US version only). 
For completeness, several other metrics are also on offer. Other packages with related topics: <code>hier.part</code>, <code>relimp</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">relaimpo</span> calculates the metrics and also offers the possibility of bootstrapping them and of displaying results in print and graphically. 
</p>
<p>It is possible to designate a subset of variables as adjustment variables that always stay in the model so that relative importance is only 
assessed among the remaining variables.
</p>
<p>Models can have up to 2-way interactions that are treated hierarchically - i.e. an interaction is only allowed in a model that also contains all its main effects.
In case of interactions, only metric <code>lmg</code> can be used. 
</p>
<p>Observations with missing values are by default excluded from the analysis for most functions. 
The function <code>mianalyze.relimp</code> allows to draw conclusions from a set of multiply imputed data sets. 
This function is currently more restrictive than the rest of the package in terms of data types and models 
that can be used (when summarizing the multiply imputed samples without calculating confidence intervals, 
all possibilities available elsewhere are also applicable in <code>mianalyze.relimp</code>).
</p>
<p><span class="pkg">relaimpo</span> does accomodate complex survey designs by making use of the facilities in package <span class="pkg">survey</span>. 
Currently, interactions and calculated variables cannot be combined with using a complex survey design in bootstrapping functions. 
</p>


<h3>Acknowlegment </h3>

<p> This package uses as an internal function the function <code>nchoosek</code> from <span class="pkg">vsn</span>, authored by Wolfgang Huber, available under LGPL. 
Furthermore, it uses a modified version of the function carscore from <span class="pkg">care</span> by Verena Zuber and Korbinian Strimmer.</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p><code>lmg</code> and <code>pmvd</code> are computer-intensive. Although they are calculated based on the 
covariance matrix, which saves substantial computing time in comparison to carrying out actual regressions, 
these methods still take quite long for problems with many regressors. Obviously, 
this is particularly relevant in combination with bootstrapping.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p> There are two versions of this package. The version on CRAN is globally licensed under GPL version 2 (or later). 
There is an extended version with the interesting additional metric <code>pmvd</code> that is licensed according to GPL version 2
under the geographical restriction "outside of the US" because of potential issues with US patent 6,640,204. This version can be obtained 
from Ulrike Groempings website (cf. references section). Whenever you load the package, a display tells you, which version you are loading. </p>
