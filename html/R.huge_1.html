<h2>Package R.huge</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><em>This package has been deprecated. Do not start building new
projects based on it.</em>
</p>
<p>DEPRECATED. Do not start building new projects based on this package. Cross-platform alternatives are the following packages: bigmemory (CRAN), ff (CRAN), BufferedMatrix (Bioconductor).  The main usage of it was inside the aroma.affymetrix package. (The package currently provides a class representing a matrix where the actual data is stored in a binary format on the local file system.  This way the size limit of the data is set by the file system and not the memory.)
