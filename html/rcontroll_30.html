<h2>A stack of <code>TROLL</code> simulations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>trollstack()</code> is an S4 class to represent a stack of <code>TROLL</code> simulation.
<code>trollstack</code> values can be accessed using object attributes in the form of
simple R objects (with <code>@</code>). They consist of eight simulation attributes: (1)
name, (2) path to saved files, (3) parameters, (4) inputs, (5) log, (6)
initial and final state, (7) ecosystem output metrics, and (8) species output
metrics. The initial and final states are represented by a table with the
spatial position, size and other relevant traits of all trees at the start
and end of the simulation. The ecosystem and species metrics are summaries of
ecosystem processes and states, such as net primary production and
aboveground biomass, and they are documented at species level and aggregated
over the entire stand.
