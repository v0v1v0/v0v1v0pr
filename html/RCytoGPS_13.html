<h2>Pre-clean Karyotypes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A function to clean karyotype data, by deleting known comments that do not
adhere to the ISCN standard.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">preclean(x, targetColumns, dirt)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing at least one column of karyotype data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>targetColumns</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either a numeric vector of column indices or a
character vector of column names.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dirt</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector containing items to delete from all karyotypes,</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The core input data worked on by the <code>RCytoGPS</code> are karyotypes,
which are text strings written to conform to the ISCN standard. At
many institutions, the cytogeneticists have developed idiosyncratic
conventions that they use to add comments into the string. In most
cases, these karyotypes are simply stored as text strings in a local
database. In particular, they are not checked for synatx or grammar
errors. By contrast, the implementation of the CytoGPS algorithm at
the web site <a href="http://cytogps.org">http://cytogps.org</a> uses a formal approach with
lexer and parser. As a result, many karyotypes are rejected by the
system.
</p>
<p>The <code>preclean</code> function uses <code>gsub</code> to delete a list
of known (local) comments from all karyotypes, making it more likley
that they will be successfully processed by the lexer and parser. We
provide an example list derived from experience at our own
institution.
</p>
<p><em>Implementation Note:</em> The <code>preclean</code> function removes
strings in the order that they are contained in the <code>dirt</code>
vector. So, you have to be carefully not to delete parts of a long
phrase before trying to delete the whole phrase. For example, you
should not remove "clonal" before removing "nonclonal". 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame of te same size and with the same number of columns as
the input data frame.
