<h2>Rsagacmd: Linking R with the open-source SAGA-GIS software.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">Rsagacmd</span> provides an R scripting interface to the open-source System
for Automated Geoscientific Analyses Geographical Information System software
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/">SAGA-GIS</a>. The current
version has been tested using SAGA-GIS versions 2.3.1 to 9.2 on Windows
(x64), macOS and Linux. Rsagacmd provides a functional approach to scripting
with SAGA-GIS by dynamically generating R functions for every SAGA-GIS tool
based on the user's current SAGA-GIS installation. These functions are
generated by the <code>saga_gis</code> function and are included within an
S3 object as a named list of libraries and tools. This structure facilitates
an easier scripting experience by organizing the large number of SAGA-GIS
tools (&gt;700) by their respective library. Interactive scripting can also
fully take advantage of code autocompletion tools (e.g. in
<a href="https://posit.co">Rstudio</a>), allowing for each tool's syntax to
be quickly recognized. Furthermore, the most common types of spatial data
(rasters using the <span class="pkg">terra</span> and <span class="pkg">stars</span> packages, and vector data
using <span class="pkg">sp</span>, <span class="pkg">sf</span> or <span class="pkg">terra</span> packages) along with non-spatial data
are seamlessly passed from R to the SAGA-GIS command line tool for
geoprocessing operations, and the results are automatically loaded as the
appropriate R object. Outputs from individual SAGA-GIS tools can also be
chained using pipes from the <span class="pkg">magrittr</span> and <span class="pkg">dplyr</span> packages to chain
complex geoprocessing operations together in a single statement.
</p>


<h3>Handling of geospatial and tabular data</h3>

<p>Rsagacmd aims to facilitate
a seamless interface to the open-source SAGA-GIS by providing access to all
SAGA-GIS geoprocessing tools in a 'R-like' manner. In addition to
generating R functions that correspond to each SAGA-GIS tool, Rsagacmd
automatically handles the passing of geospatial and tabular data contained
from the R environment to SAGA-GIS.
</p>
<p>Rsagacmd uses the SAGA-GIS command line interface to perform geoprocessing
operations. Therefore, spatial data can be passed to any Rsagacmd function as
a path to the input data, assuming that the data is stored in the appropriate
file formats (e.g. GDAL-supported single-band rasters, OGR supported vector
data, and comma- or tab-delimited text files for tabular data). In addition,
Rsagacmd also supports the following R object classes to pass data to
SAGA-GIS, and to load the results back into the R environment:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Raster data handling is provided by the R <span class="pkg">terra</span> and <span class="pkg">stars</span>
packages. Raster-based outputs from SAGA-GIS tools are loaded as SpatRaster
or stars objects. For more details, see the 'Handling of raster data'.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Vector features that result from SAGA-GIS geoprocessing operations are
output in ESRI Shapefile format and are loaded into the R environment as
simple features objects
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Tabular data from SAGA-GIS tools are loaded as data frames
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The results from tools that return multiple outputs are loaded into the R
environment as a named list of the appropriate R object classes.
</p>


<h3>Multi-band raster data</h3>

<p>SAGA-GIS does not handle multi-band rasters
and the native SAGA GIS Binary file format (.sgrd) supports only single
band data. Therefore when passing raster data to most SAGA-GIS tools using
Rsagacmd, the data should represent single raster bands. Subsetting of
raster data is performed automatically by Rsagacmd in the case of when a
single band from a multiband SpatRaster or stars object is passed to a
SAGA-GIS tool. This occurs in by either passing the filename of the raster
to the SAGA-GIS command line, or by writing the data to a temporary file.
</p>


<h3>Combining SAGA-GIS tools with pipes</h3>

<p>For convenience, outputs from
SAGA-GIS tools are automatically saved to tempfiles if outputs are not
explicitly stated as arguments when calling the function. This was
implemented so that the user can create complex workflows based on little
code. It is also means that several processing steps can be combined or
chained in a convenient manner using pipes from the <span class="pkg">magritrr</span> package.
When using pipes, all of the intermediate processing steps are dealt with
automatically by saving the outputs as tempfiles, and then in turn passing
the output to the next function in the chain. Note that when dealing with
high-resolution and/or larger raster data, these tempfiles can start to
consume a significant amount of disk space during a session. If required,
these temporary files can be cleaned during the session using the
saga_remove_tmpfiles function.
