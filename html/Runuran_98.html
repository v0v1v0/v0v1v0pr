<h3>Details</h3>

<p>UNU.RAN is a library of so called black-box algorithms. For algorithms
based on the rejection method this means that hat and squeezes are
created automatically during the setup. Obviously not all algorithms
work for all distribution. Then usually the setup fails (which is
good, since then one does not silently obtain a random sample from a
distribution other then the requested.) 
</p>
<p>Although we have tested these algorithms with a lot of distributions
(including those with extreme properties) there is still some (minor)
chance that hat and squeezes are computed without any warnings, but
are incorrect, i.e., the inequalities
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">squeeze(x) \le density(x) \le hat(x)</code>
</p>

<p>are not satisfied for all <code class="reqn">x</code>.
This might happen due to serious round-off errors for densities with
extreme properties (e.g., sharp and narrow peaks). But it also might
be caused by some incorrect additional information about the
distribution given by the user which has not been detected by various
checks during the setup. If one is unsure about his or her chosen
generation method one can check these inequalities.
</p>
<p>Routine <code>unuran.verify.hat</code> allows to run generator <code>unr</code>
and check whether the two inequalities are violated. This is done for 
every point <code class="reqn">x</code> that is sampled from the hat distribution. This
includes also those points that are rejected.
The function counts the occurrences of such evaluations and 
returns the ratio of this number and the sample size <code>n</code>.
(It is thus a little bit too high since the total number of generated
but rejected points is not known.)
Yet, it does not provide any information about the magnitude of
violation of the inequality.
</p>
<p>If <code>show</code> is <code>TRUE</code> then this routine prints this ratio and
some diagnostcs to the console.
</p>
<p>Routine <code>unuran.verify.hat</code> does not work for algorithms that do
not implement a rejection method.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Ratio of number occurrences where the hat and squeezes violate the
inequality and the sample size.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Due to round-off errors there might exist a few points where the ratio
<code class="reqn">density(x) / hat(x)</code> is slightly larger than 1.
In our experiments we observed a few cases where this ratio was as
large as <code class="reqn">1+10^{-8}</code> for some points although we could
proof (using real numbers instead of floating point numbers) that hat
and squeeze are computed correctly.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are cases where, due to the limitation of
floating point arithmetic, it is not possible to sample from the
target distribution at all. 
The Gamma distribution with extremely small shape parameter, say
0.0001, is such an example. Then the continuous Gamma distribution
degenerates to a point distribution with only a few points with
significant mass.
