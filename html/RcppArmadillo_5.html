<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Set the Armadillo Random Number Generator to the given
value
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">armadillo_set_seed(val)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>val</code></td>
<td>
<p>The seed used to initialize Armadillo's random
number generator.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Depending on whether RcppArmadillo was compiled for the C++98 standard
(currently the default) or for C++11 (optional), two different RNGs may be used.
This function resets either. For C++98, the R programming language's RNG is used.
For C++11, the RNG included in the <code>&lt;random&gt;</code> library is used only when
<code>#define ARMA_USE_CXX11_RNG</code> is placed before <code>#include &lt;RcppArmadillo.h&gt;</code>.
Otherwise, the R programming language's RNG will be used.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function is invoked for its side effect and has no
return value.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This has been found to not work as espected in
<span class="pkg">RStudio</span> as its code also uses the system RNG library.
You may have to either not run within <span class="pkg">RStudio</span> or
change your code to use a different RNG such as the one
from R.
</p>

via <span class="pkg">Rcpp</span>.
