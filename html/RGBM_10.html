<h2>
Get indices of experiments where knockout or knockdown happened
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function provides the indices of all those samples (out of N) where it is known apriori that a gene was either knocked-out or was knocked-down. This information is useful for the <code>null_model_refinement_step</code> which utilizes the <code>z_score_effect</code> technique (with the help of this information).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_ko_experiments(K)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>K</code></td>
<td>

<p>N-by-p initial perturbation matrix. It directly corresponds to E matrix, e.g. if K[i,j] is equal to 1, it means that gene j was knocked-out in experiment i. Single gene knock-out experiments are rows of K with only one value 1. Colnames of K is set to be the set of all genes.  By default it's a matrix of zeros of the same size as E, e.g. unknown initial perturbation state of genes.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Return a vector containing the indices of all the samples where a gene was knocked-out/down.
