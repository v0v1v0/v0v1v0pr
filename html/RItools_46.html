<h2>ASSIST Trial Data from Yudkin and Moher 2001</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The ASSIST Trial baseline data from Yudkin and Moher 2001 consist of 21
general practices containing 2142 patients used for the design of a
randomized trial which assigned to three treatments aiming to compare methods
of preventing coronary heart disease. This data frame is aggregated
to the practice level. We added a simulated randomized treatment variable.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with  21 rows and 8 columns
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p> n_practice: Number of patients with CHD in the practice
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> assessed: Whether a patient was coded as "adequately assessed" (the
outcome of the study, measured here at baseline).
