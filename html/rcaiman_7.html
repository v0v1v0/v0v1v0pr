<h2>Calculate zenith raster coordinates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate zenith raster coordinates from points digitized with the
open-source software package ‘ImageJ’. The zenith is the point on the image
that represents the zenith when upward-looking photographs are taken with the
optical axis vertically aligned.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">calc_zenith_colrow(path_to_csv)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path_to_csv</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character vector. Path to a CSV file created with the
<a href="https://imagej.net/ij/docs/guide/146-19.html#sec:Multi-point-Tool">point selection tool of ‘ImageJ’ software</a>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The technique described under the headline ‘Optical center characterization’
of the <a href="https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/can-eye/content/download/3052/30819/version/4/file/CAN_EYE_User_Manual.pdf">user manual of the software Can-Eye</a>
can be used to acquire the data for determining the zenith coordinates. This
technique was used by Pekin and Macfarlane (2009), among others.
Briefly, it consists in drilling a small hole in the cap of the fisheye lens
(it must be away from the center of the cap), and taking about ten
photographs without removing the cap. The cap must be rotated about 30º
before taking each photograph.(<strong>NOTE:</strong>
The method implemented here does not support multiple holes).
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://imagej.net/ij/docs/guide/146-19.html#sec:Multi-point-Tool">point selection tool of ‘ImageJ’ software</a>
should be used to manually digitize the white dots and create a CSV file to
feed this function. After digitizing the points on the image, use the
dropdown menu Analyze&gt;Measure to open the Results window. To obtain the CSV
file, use File&gt;Save As...
</p>
<p>Another method–only valid when enough of the circle perimeter is depicted in
the image– is taking a very bright picture (for example, a picture of the
corner of a room with walls painted in light colors) with the lens completely
free (do not use any mount). Then, digitize points over the circle perimeter.
This was the method used for producing the example file (see Examples). It is
worth noting that the perimeter of the circle depicted in a circular
hemispherical photograph is not necessarily the horizon.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Numeric vector of length two. Raster coordinates of the zenith,
assuming a lens facing up with its optical axis parallel to the vertical
line. It is important to note the difference between the raster coordinates
and the Cartesian coordinates. In the latter,  the vertical axis value
decreases downward, but the opposite is true for the raster coordinates,
which works like a spreadsheet.
