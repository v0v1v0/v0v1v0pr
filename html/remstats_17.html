<h2>FEtype</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Specifies the statistic for fixed effects for event types in the
tie-oriented model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">FEtype()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Fixed effects for event types capture the variation in event rate across
different event types (e.g., see Butts, 2008). The specification of FEtype
results in the creation of C-1 statistics, were C is the number of different
event types in the riskset. Let one of the event types, e.g. <em>c = 1</em>,
represent the reference category. Than, for every event type
<em>c = 2, ..., C</em>, a statistic is created that at timepoint <em>t</em> for
dyad <em>(i,j,c)</em> is equal to 1 if <em>c</em> is equal to the respective
event type and equal to 0 otherwise (i.e., dummy variables are created).
Note that specifying fixed effects for event types is only available when
event types are modeled in the dependent variable.
