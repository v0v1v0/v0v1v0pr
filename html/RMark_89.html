<h2>Process encounter history dataframe for MARK analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Prior to analyzing the data, this function initializes several variables
(e.g., number of capture occasions, time intervals) that are often specific
to the capture-recapture model being fitted to the data.  It also is used to
1) define groups in the data that represent different levels of one or more
factor covariates (e.g., sex), 2) define time intervals between capture
occasions (if not 1), and 3) create an age structure for the data, if any.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">process.data(
  data,
  begin.time = 1,
  model = "CJS",
  mixtures = 1,
  groups = NULL,
  allgroups = FALSE,
  age.var = NULL,
  initial.ages = c(0),
  age.unit = 1,
  time.intervals = NULL,
  nocc = NULL,
  strata.labels = NULL,
  counts = NULL,
  reverse = FALSE,
  areas = NULL,
  events = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For examples of <code>data</code>, see
<code>dipper</code>,<code>edwards.eberhardt</code>,<code>example.data</code>.
The structure of the encounter history and the analysis depends on the
analysis model to some extent. Thus, it is necessary to process a dataframe
with the encounter history (<code>ch</code>) and a chosen <code>model</code> to define
the relevant values.  For example, number of capture occasions (<code>nocc</code>)
is automatically computed based on the length of the encounter history
(<code>ch</code>) in <code>data</code>; however, this is dependent on the type of
analysis model.  For models such as "CJS", "Pradel" and others, it is simply
the length of <code>ch</code>.  Whereas, for "Burnham" and "Barker" models,the
encounter history contains both capture and resight/recovery values so
<code>nocc</code> is one-half the length of <code>ch</code>. Likewise, the number of
<code>time.intervals</code> depends on the model.  For models, such as "CJS",
"Pradel" and others, the number of <code>time.intervals</code> is <code>nocc-1</code>;
whereas, for capture&amp;recovery(resight) models the number of
<code>time.intervals</code> is <code>nocc</code>. The default time interval is unit time
(1) and if this is adequate, the function will assign the appropriate
length.  A processed data frame can only be analyzed using the model that
was specified.  The <code>model</code> value is used by the functions
<code>make.design.data</code>, <code>add.design.data</code>, and
<code>make.mark.model</code> to define the model structure as it relates to
the data. Thus, if the data are going to be analysed with different
underlying models, create different processed data sets with the model name
as an extension.  For example, <code>dipper.cjs=process.data(dipper)</code> and
<code>dipper.popan=process.data(dipper,model="POPAN")</code>.
</p>
<p>This function will report inconsistencies in the lengths of the capture
history values and when invalid entries are given in the capture history.
For example, with the "CJS" model, the capture history should only contain 0
and 1 whereas for "Barker" it can contain 0,1,2.  For "Multistrata" models,
the code will automatically identify the number of strata and strata labels
based on the unique alphabetic codes used in the capture histories.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>begin.time</code> specifies the time for the first capture
occasion.  This is used in creating the levels of the time factor variable
in the design data and for labelling parameters. If the <code>begin.time</code>
varies by group, enter a vector of times with one for each group. Note that
the time values for survivals are based on the beginning of the survival
interval and capture probabilities are labeled based on the time of the
capture occasion.  Likewise, age labels for survival are the ages at the
beginning times of the intervals and for capture probabilities it is the age
at the time of capture/recapture.
</p>
<p><code>groups</code> is a vector of variable names that are contained in
<code>data</code>.  Each must be a factor variable. A group is created for each
unique combination of the levels of the factor variables.  In the first
example given below <code>groups=c("sex","age","region")</code>. which creates
groups defined by the levels of <code>sex</code>, <code>age</code> and <code>region</code>.
There should be 2(sexes)*3(ages)*4(regions)=24 groups but in actuality there
are only 16 in the data because there are only 2 age groups for each sex.
Age group 1 and 2 for M and age groups 2 and 3 for F.  This was done to
demonstrate that the code will only use groups that have 1 or more capture
histories unless <code>allgroups=TRUE</code>.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>age.var=2</code> specifies that the second grouping variable in
<code>groups</code> represents an age variable.  It could have been named
something different than age. If a variable in <code>groups</code> is named
<code>age</code> then it is not necessary to specify <code>age.var</code>.
<code>initial.age</code> specifies that the age at first capture of the age levels
is 0,1 and 2 while the age classes were designated as 1,2,3. The actual ages
for the age classes do not have to be sequential or ordered, but ordering
will cause less confusion.  Thus levels 1,2,3 could represent initial ages
of 0,4,6 or 6,0,4. The argument age.unit is the amount an animal ages for
each unit of time and the default is 1.  The default for <code>initial.age</code>
is 0 for each group, in which case, <code>age</code> represents time since marking
(first capture) rather than the actual age of the animal.
