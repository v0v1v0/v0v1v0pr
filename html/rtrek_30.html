<h2>Star Trek novel-based timeline.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data frame with 2122 rows and 14 columns containing Star Trek timeline
data. This dataset is novel-driven, meaning that the timeline entries (rows)
provide a chronologically ordered list of licensed Star Trek novels.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">tlBooks

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Specifically, this curated dataset includes data derived from historical
timeline information in the appendix of the Star Trek reference manual,
Voyages of the Imagination, which provides information on the large
collection of licensed Star Trek literature. The authors note that the
original timeline includes "novels, short stories, eBooks, novelizations,
Simon &amp; Schuster Audio original audio books, Minstrel Books young adult
books, and classic novels from Bantam and Ballantine Books, published through
October 2006."
</p>
<p>While this data is very informative, it is clearly many years out of date. It
is also necessarily speculative. Settings are determined based in part on
what is interpreted to be the intention of a given author for a given
production. Nevertheless, it still represents possibly the highest quality
representation of the chronological ordering of Star Trek fiction that
combines episodes and movies with written works. The concurrent timeline of
Star Trek TV episodes and movies are interleaved with the novels and other
written fiction for fuller context resulting in a much richer timeline.
See the <code>tlEvents</code> dataset for an event-driven timeline.
