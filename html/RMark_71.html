<h2>Truncate capture histories for multi-state models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Decompose full capture history to releases followed by k recapture occasions. If a recapture occasion occurs before k
occasions, the capture history is finished at the first recapture and right padded with "." which effectively acts like a 
loss on capture. The recapture is then a new release and new capture history. If there are no recaptures within k occasions, it has a release followed by k 0's. If the release is such that adding k occasions is
greater than the length of the original capture history, then the new history is left padded with 0's. Capture histories that end
with a capture on the last occasion do not generate a new capture history because there are no possible recaptures and thus contain no
information in a CJS format MS model.  All freq and covariates are copied with newly generated truncated capture histories.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">MStruncate(data, k = 5)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>dataframe containing at least one character field named ch; can also contain frequency in numeric field freq and any other covariates.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of recapture occasions after release; new capture histories are of length k+1</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>dataframe with field ch and freq (default to 1) and any covariates included in argument data; it also contains a factor variable
release which is the first occasion which should be used as a group variable so the begin.time can be set for each release cohort to 
maintain the original times, as shown in the example.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
data(mstrata)
df=MStruncate(mstrata,k=2)
dp=process.data(df,model="Multistrata",groups=c("release"),begin.time=1:max(as.numeric(df$release)))
ddl=make.design.data(dp)
table(ddl$S$release,ddl$S$time)
table(ddl$p$release,ddl$p$time)


</code></pre>
