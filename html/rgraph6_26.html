<h2>Example vectors of 'graph6', 'sparse6', and 'digraph6' codes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Objects <code>g6</code>, <code>s6</code>, and <code>d6</code> are vectors of codes in 'graph6', 'sparse6', and
'digraph6' representations respectively. Object <code>sampleg6</code> is a vector of
'graph6' codes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">g6

s6

d6

sampleg6
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The three objects <code>g6</code>, <code>s6</code>, and <code>d6</code> are character vectors of
length 20 corresponding to undirected (in case of <code>g6</code> and <code>s6</code>) and
directed (in case of <code>d6</code>) graphs of varying sizes and densities.
</p>
<p>Object <code>sampleg6</code> is a character vector of length 9 of
undirected graphs in 'graph6' format.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Graphs in <code>g6</code>, <code>s6</code>, and <code>d6</code> objects were generated using the
common algorithm which consists of the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> For each value from the vector of sizes of the node set (15, 30, 60, 120)...
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ... generate a vector of edge counts (size of the edge set) of length 5
ranging from a single edge up to an edge count corresponding to the density
of 0.2.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Given the node set sizes (item 1) and edge set sizes (item 2) sample
undirected graphs from GNM model.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> These undirected graphs are encoded in <code>g6</code> and <code>s6</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Directed graphs were created by turning undirected edges to directed
arcs in an arbitrary manner. These are encoded in the <code>d6</code> object.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
