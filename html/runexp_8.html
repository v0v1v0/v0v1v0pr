<h2>Player statistics and probabilities for WKU softball</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Statistics and calculated probabilities for each player on 
the 2013 Western Kentucky University softball team. Data is stored in 
two data frames: <code>wku_stats</code> contains the game statistics for 
each player and <code>wku_probs</code> contains the calculated probabilities 
for each player.  Player names and numbers have been replaced with 
random letters/numbers to preserve anonymity.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">wku_stats

wku_probs
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>tbl_df</code> (inherits from <code>tbl</code>, <code>data.frame</code>) with 18 rows and 23 columns.
</p>
<p>An object of class <code>spec_tbl_df</code> (inherits from <code>tbl_df</code>, <code>tbl</code>, <code>data.frame</code>) with 18 rows and 11 columns.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>wku_stats</code> contains the raw player data taken from the 2013 WKU
softball team's webpage.  <code>wku_probs</code> contains the 
player probabilities calculated using <code>prob_calc</code>.  Together, they provide
an example of calculating probabilities from player statistics.  See 
<code>?prob_calc</code> for more details on the columns of the two data frames.
</p>
<p><code>wku_probs</code> is designed for use with <code>chain</code> and <code>sim</code>.  It 
additionally contains a <code>fast</code> column that indicates whether each player is
considered fast.  This column is not necessary for running <code>chain</code> 
and <code>sim</code>, since it is equivalent to the default assignments.
