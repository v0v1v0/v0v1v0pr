<h2>Class "Entry"</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Class <code>Entry</code> is responsible for creating assessment tasks according to the
QTI 2.1 standard. These tasks include one or more instances of text input
fields (with numeric or text answers) or dropdown lists.
</p>


<h3>Slots</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>identifier</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A character representing the unique identifier of the
assessment task. By default, it is generated as 'id_task_dddd', where dddd
represents random digits.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>title</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A character representing the title of the XML file associated
with the task. By default, it takes the value of the identifier.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>content</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A list of character content to form the text of the question,
which can include HTML tags. For tasks of the Entry type, it must also
contain at least one instance of Gap objects, such as TextGap,
TextGapOpal, NumericGap, or InlineChoice.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>prompt</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>An optional character representing a simple question text,
consisting of one paragraph. This can supplement or replace content in the
task. Default is "".</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>points</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric value, optional, representing the number of points for
the entire task. Default is 1, but pay attention:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> For tasks of the Entry type, it is
calculated as the sum of the gap points by default.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For tasks of the MatchTable type, it can also be calculated as the sum
of points for individual answers, when provided.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For tasks of the MultipleChoice type, points is numeric vector and
required. Each number in this vector determines the number of points that
will be awarded to a candidate if they select the corresponding answer. The
order of the scores must match the order of the <code>choices</code>. It is possible
to assign negative values to incorrect answers. All answers with a
positive score are considered correct.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><code>feedback</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A list containing feedback messages for candidates. Each
element of the list should be an instance of either ModalFeedback,
CorrectFeedback, or WrongFeedback class.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>calculator</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A character, optional, determining whether to show a
calculator to the candidate. Possible values:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> "simple"
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "scientific"
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><code>files</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A character vector, optional, containing paths to files that will
be accessible to the candidate during the test/exam.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>metadata</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>An object of class QtiMetadata that holds metadata information
about the task.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
