<h2>RasterList: A package for Rasters Where Cells are Generic Objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The aim of this package is to develop a way to make some complex operations on each
cells of a Raster Maps. Generally raster contains numeric values in each cells and in each band. 
Sometimes complex operation required the definition of particular object, in case such operation should be executed 
for each cell of a raster map, it becomes challanging. Then <code>RasterList-package</code> makes these operations 
easy to be implented with few lines of codes.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>RasterList-class</code> is a S4 class that inherits the <code>RasterLayer-class</code> and it  an added slot called <code>list</code>. The <code>list</code> slot is a <code>list</code> object of so many elements how many are the cells of the inherited  <code>RasterLayer-class</code> class,
so that there is bijective corrensponce between a raster cell and a list element.
The 	RasterList package provides three categories of important functions:
</p>
<p><code>rasterList</code>: it is the constructor of a  <code>RasterList-class</code> object from a generic <code>object</code>, it also transforms a <code>RasterList-class</code> into another one throungh a function argument. 
</p>
<p><code>rasterListFun</code>: it is a function that constructs  a  particular <code>RasterList-class</code> object in which the objects are <code>function</code>-type. 
</p>
<p><code>RasterListApply</code>: it is a function that allows to operate among two or more <code>RasterList-class</code> objects defined in the same spatial extent through a generic function <code>fun(x,y,...)</code> where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are each cell/element of two <code>RasterList-class</code> objects given as arguments <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> of <code>RasterListApply</code>.
</p>
<p>Some examples, concerning the fitting of a probability function for each cell of a stack (<code>RasterStack-class</code> object) of precipitation time-series or the estimation of soil water retention curve for each cell of a raster map,   are  shown throughout the package manual. 
The precipitation example dataset in raster format were extracted by the CHIRPS database:
