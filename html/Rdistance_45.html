<h2>Brewer's Sparrow detection data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Detection data from line transect surveys for 
Brewer's sparrow on 72 transects 
located on a 4105 km^2 study 
area in central Wyoming. Data were collected by 
Dr. Jason Carlisle of the Wyoming Cooperative Fish &amp; Wildlife
Research Unit in 2012. Each transect was 500 meters long.
See the package vignettes for tutorials of the basic analysis.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data.frame containing 356 rows and 5 columns.  Each row represents
a detected group of sparrows.  Column descriptions: 
</p>
 
<ol>
<li> <p><code>siteID</code>: Factor (72 levels), the site or transect where the detection
was made.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>groupsize</code>: Number, the number of individuals within
the detected group.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>sightdist</code>: Number, distance (m) from the observer to the detected group.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>sightangle</code>: Number, the angle (degrees) from the transect 
line to the detected group.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>dist</code>: Number, the perpendicular, off-transect distance (m) from the
transect to the detected group.  This is the distance used in analysis.
Calculated using <code>perpDists</code>.  </p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The Brewer's sparrow data are a subset of the data collected 
by Jason Carlisle and various field technicians for his Ph.D. from the 
Department of Ecology, University of Wyoming, in 2017.  This portion of 
Jason's work was funded by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department through agreements 
with the University of Wyoming's  Cooperative Fish &amp; Wildlife
Research Unit (2012).
