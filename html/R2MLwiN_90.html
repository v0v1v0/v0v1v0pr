<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>xc</code> dataset is one of the sample datasets provided with the
multilevel-modelling software package MLwiN (Rasbash et al., 2009), analysed
by Paterson (1991). The data are cross-classified in that not all children
who attended the same primary school subsequently entered the same secondary
school. See also Rasbash et al. (2012).
