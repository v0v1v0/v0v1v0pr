<h2>Lichen data from the Current Vegetation Survey</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data were collected between 1993 and 1999 as part of the Lichen Air
Quality surveys on public lands in Oregon and southern Washington.
Observations were obtained from 1-acre (0.4 ha) plots at Current
Vegetation Survey (CVS) sites. Indicator variables denote the presences
and absences of 7 lichen species. Data for each sampled plot include
the topographic variables elevation, aspect, and slope; bioclimatic
predictors including maximum, minimum, daily, and average temperatures,
relative humidity precipitation, evapotranspiration, and vapor
pressure; and vegetation variables including the average age of
the dominant conifer and percent conifer cover. The data in lichenTest
were collected from half-acre plots at CVS sites in the same
geographical region and contains many of the same variables,
including presences and absences for the 7 lichen species. As such,
it is a good test dataset for predictive methods applied to the Lichen
Air Quality data.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 840 observations and 40 variables. One variable is
a location identifier, 7 (coded as 0 and 1) identify the presence or
absence of a type of lichen species, and 32 are characteristics of
the survey site where the data were collected.
</p>
<p>There were 12 monthly values in the original data for each of the
bioclimatic predictors. Principal components analyses suggested
that for each of these predictors 2 principal components explained
the vast majority (95.0%-99.5%) of the total variability. Based on
these analyses, indices were created for each set of bioclimatic
predictors. The variables with the suffix Ave in the variable name
are the average of 12 monthly variables. The variables with the
suffix Diff are contrasts between the sum of the April-September
monthly values and the sum of the October-December and January-March
monthly values, divided by 12. Roughly speaking, these are
summer-to-winter contrasts.
