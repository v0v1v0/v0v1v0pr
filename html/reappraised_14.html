<h2>Compares observed and expected distribution of difference in numbers of participants between groups in two-arm randomised trials</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates plot of observed to expected numbers and ratios for differences in numbers of participants between trial groups<br></p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sr_fn(
  df = sr_data,
  br = "no",
  block = data.frame(study = "", fbsz = "", n_fb = "", df = ""),
  title = "",
  verbose = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>data frame generated from load_clean function</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>br</code></td>
<td>
<p>block randomisation: 'yes' or 'no'. If 'no' runs function as if all trials used simple randomisation. If 'yes' performs simple calculations as if block randomised</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>block</code></td>
<td>
<p>an additional option for studies using block randomisation. block is a data frame containing columns named study (for study id); fbsz (for the final block size); n_fb (for number of participants in the final block); df (the difference between groups)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>title</code></td>
<td>
<p>title name for plots (optional)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE or FALSE indicates whether progress bar and comments in block randomisation function show and whether to print plot</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An example is for Sato and Iwamoto trials in Bolland 2016<br>
Bolland MJ, Avenell A, Gamble GD, Grey A. Systematic review and statistical analysis of the integrity of 33 randomized controlled trials. Neurology 2016;87:2391-2402.
</p>
<p>Returns a list containing 4 objects and (if verbose = TRUE) prints the plot sr_graph
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>list containing 4 objects as described
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> sr_graph = plot of observed to expected numbers for differences between numbers of participants in trial groups
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> sr_graph = plot of observed to expected numbers and ratios for differences between numbers of participants in trial groups
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> sr_individual_graphs = list containing 2 plots making up composite figure
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> sr_data = data frame containing data for plots
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># load example data
sr_data &lt;- load_clean(import= "no", file.cat = "SI_cat", sr= "yes",
format.cat = "wide")$sr_data


# run function (takes only a few seconds)
sr_fn()$sr_graph

# to import an excel spreadsheet (modify using local path,
# file and sheet name, range, and format):

# get path for example files
path &lt;- system.file("extdata", "reappraised_examples.xlsx", package = "reappraised",
                    mustWork = TRUE)
# delete file name from path
path &lt;- sub("/[^/]+$", "", path)

# load data
sr_data &lt;- load_clean(import= "yes", sr = "yes", dir = path,
   file.name.cat = "reappraised_examples.xlsx", sheet.name.cat = "SI_cat",
   range.name.cat = "A:D", format.cat = "wide")$sr_data

# function has an additional option for block randomisation.
#  If studies are block randomised and the final block size is known,
#  the number of participants in the final block can be determined.
#  The distribution of differences between groups for the final block
#  can be compared to the expected distribution
#
#  Few studies provide all these details so it seems unlikely this function
#  would get used often

# Example takes only a few seconds to run

sr_fn(br = "yes", block = data.frame(study = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10),
         fb_sz= c(2,4,6,8,10,12,8,8,6,14), n_fb = c(1,1,4,5,7,8,4,6,2,10),
         df=c(1,1,0,1,3,4,2,2,0,0)))$sr_graph
