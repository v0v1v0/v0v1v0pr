<h2>Plot method for YonX objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Graphics for Shrinkage in "Simple" Linear Regression: Models with only p=1
X-variable. The default is to [1] display four TRACES in one plot and then to [2]
display the "Y on X" scatter-plot with Three Fitted Lines: the OLS fit is BLUE, the
optimally Shrunken fit is "purple", and the largest m-Extent of shrinkage with Relative
MSE at most that of OLS is "red". Note: Whenever model lack-of-fit is small, these 3
m-Extents can be quite close to each other.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  ## S3 method for class 'YonX'
plot(x, trace = "all", ... )
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Output list object of class "YonX".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trace</code></td>
<td>
<p>One of EIGHT possible options: "all" to display 4 traces on the first plot,
then the "YonX" scatter plot; "seq" to display 5 full-sized plots in sequence (in
response to user prompts); "coef" to display only the estimated beta coefficient trace
(a straight line); "rmse" to display only the (quadratic) estimated relative MSE risk
trace; "spat" to display only the delta-factor trace (a straight line); "lglk" to
display only the "-2 log(Likelihood Ratio)" trace; "YonX" to display only the Y-vs-X
scatter plot with 3 fitted-lines: the OLS fitted line (BLUE), the "purple" Maximum-Likelihood
(optimally biased) line, and the "red" line marking the most shrinkage with estimated
MSE Relative Risk less than or equal to that of OLS; or "exev" to display only the Excess
Eigenvalue trace that is redundant with the "rmse" trace.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The effects of Shrinkage on Simple Linear Regression models (p = 1) are, in reality,
NOT easier to illustrate than the corresponding effects on Multiple Linear Regressiom models
(p &gt; 1). In both situations, alternative estimates of effects and risks abound. For example,
the estimate chosen can be [1] Maximum Likelihood under Normal-theory, [2] Unbiased under
Normal-theory or [3] have "Correct Range". [See Obenchain (1978), equations (3.3) to (3.5),
and corresponding text.] When a graphic contains only a single curve, a "reality" is that
the general "shape" of the curve (plus any highlighted "points" on that curve) should "look
right" or, at the very least, "reasonable".
</p>
<p>My choices among alternative estimates of (nonlinear) MSE risk were initially made roughly
30 years ago ...and have remained mostly unchanged (primarily) for consistency with earlier
versions of RXshrink.
</p>
<p>The NEW "rmse" TRACE for class "YonX" displays MSE Relative Risk estimates from the "qrsk"
vector rather than the (traditional) "rmse" estimates for all p = 1 models. This allows MSE
Relative Risk estimates to <em>satisfy a Quadratic equation</em> and give the CORRECT visual
impression that Relative Risk is MINIMIZED at the ML "purple" point and dotted-line at m =
(1-dMSE). Note that the Relative Risk then starts to increase for m &gt; (1-dMSE) and returns
to its initial starting level at m = 0 ["blue" point and dotted-line] when the m-Extent
reaches m = 2*(1-dMSE) ["red" point and dotted-line.] Finally, when 0.5 &lt; dMSE &lt; 1, the
Relative Risk then continues to increase, reaching its Maximum at m = 1. As argued in
Obenchain(1978), the "Good" Shrinkage Range is 0 &lt; m &lt; 2*(1-dMSE), between the "blue" and
"red" vertical dotted-lines on the "rmse" TRACE.
