<h2>Read and combine raw OpenSesame data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Read and combine multiple raw data files that were collected with OpenSesame
(Mathot, Schreij, &amp; Theeuwes, 2012). The files will be merged into one
data.frame.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">read_opensesame(
  directory = ".",
  subdirectories = FALSE,
  extension = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>directory</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string. Name of the folder where the raw data
are stored. If it does not contain an absolute path, the file name is
relative to the current working directory. Defaults to current working
directory.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subdirectories</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating whether the directory contains
subdirectories. If <code>FALSE</code> (the default), it is assumed that all raw
data files are directly included in the directory. If <code>TRUE</code>, it is
assumed that the raw data files are stored in folders within the directory.
Alternatively, a vector of folder names that contain the raw data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>extension</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional character string. If specified, only files
ending with the specified extension will be merged.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>data.frame</code> to which the new data will be added. This is
optional, and an empty <code>data.frame</code> is used if none is provided.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating whether function should report its
progress.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>OpenSesame generally produces an output <code>.csv</code> file for each participant
in the experiment. This is handy during data collection, but for the analysis
it is often useful to combine many such files into a single
<code>data.frame</code>. This is the single task of the <code>read_opensesame</code>
function, which loads all files from a given directory and attempts to
combine them into a <code>data.frame</code>.
</p>
<p><code>read_opensesame</code> provides a wrapper around read_bulk to load the
raw data files. After loading, the different data files are merged using
rbind.fill. This function can deal with varying column names
across files, and still places data into the appropriate columns. If a column
is not present in a specific file, it will be filled with <code>NA</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.frame containing the merged raw data.
</p>
<p>One column in the data.frame (<code>File</code>) contains the name of the raw
data file. If the <code>subdirectories</code> option is set, an additional column
(<code>Subdirectory</code>) with the name of the subdirectory is added.
</p>
