<h2>Create table of fixed forecast catches</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Processing values of dead or retained biomass from timeseries output
to fit the format required at the bottom of the forecast file.
This can be used to map the catches resulting from forecasting with a particular
harvest control rule into a model representing a different state of nature.
This is a common task for US west coast groundfish but might be useful elsewhere.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SS_ForeCatch(
  replist,
  yrs = 2021:2032,
  average = FALSE,
  avg.yrs = 2016:2020,
  total = NULL,
  digits = 2,
  dead = TRUE,
  zeros = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>replist</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list object created by <code>SS_output()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>yrs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Range of years in which to fill in forecast catches from timeseries</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>average</code></td>
<td>
<p>Use average catch over a range of years for forecast
(as opposed to using forecast based on control rule)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>avg.yrs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Range of years to average over</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>total</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either single value or vector of annual total forecast catch
used to scale values (especially if values are from average catches).
For west coast groundfish, total might be ACL for next 2 forecast years</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>digits</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of digits to round to in table</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dead</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE/FALSE switch to choose dead catch instead of retained catch.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>zeros</code></td>
<td>
<p>Include entries with zero catch (TRUE/FALSE)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
