<h2> Campbell Bushfire Data with added missing data items (10 percent)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set is based on the bushfire data set which was used by
Campbell (1984) to locate bushfire scars - see  <code>bushfire</code>
in package <code>robustbase</code>. The original dataset contains satelite
measurements on five frequency bands, corresponding to each of 38 pixels.
The data set is very well studied (Maronna and Yohai, 1995; Maronna
and Zamar, 2002). There are 12 clear outliers: 33-38, 32, 7-11 and 12 and 13 are
suspect.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(bush10)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 38 observations on 6 variables.
</p>
<p>The original data set consists of 38 observations in 5 variables.
Based on it four new data sets are created in which some of the data
items are replaced by missing values with a simple "missing completely
at random " mechanism. For this purpose independent Bernoulli trials
are realized for each data item with a probability of success 0.1
where success means that the corresponding item is set to missing.)

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## The following code will result in exactly the same output

## Not run: 
##  This is the code with which the missing data were created:
##  Creates a data set with missing values (for testing purposes)
##  from a complete data set 'x'. The probability of
##  each item being missing is 'pr'.
