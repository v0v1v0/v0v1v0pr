<h2>Split a Multiblock JCAMP-DX File into Individual Files</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Process a multiblock JCAMP-DX file into separate files, one for each data set.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">splitMultiblockDX(file = NULL, subdir = "data_sets")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file</code></td>
<td>
<p>Length one character giving the name of the multiblock file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subdir</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character.  If not <code>NULL</code>, a subdirectory by this name will be 
created in the working directory, and the individual files will be placed
in this subdirectory.  If the subdirectory already exists, an error will be thrown.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list is returned invisibly that has one DX data set per list element.  <span class="pkg">Individual files
are written into the current directory if <code>subdir = NULL</code>, so you probably want
to work on a copy of the data
in this case</span>.  File names are extracted from the
<code>##TITLE= sample_name</code> field and will be <code>sample_name</code> (more precisely,
the name will be whatever follows <code>##TITLE=</code> on the line).  If
sample names are duplicated the output files will be overwritten as the file
is processed (with a warning).  In this case you should open the multiblock file in a plain text
editor and search for <code>##TITLE=</code>, then edit the names to be unique before
running this function.  Also, you should ensure that <code>sample_name</code> will
result in a valid file name on your operating system.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">Individual data sets are written into the current directory if you set <code>subdir</code>
to <code>NULL</code>, so you may want to work on a copy of the data in this case</span>.
