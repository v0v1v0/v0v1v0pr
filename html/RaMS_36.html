<h2>Shrink mzML files by including only data points near masses of interest</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>mzML files can be annoyingly large if only a few masses are of interest. This large size makes it
difficult to share them online for debugging purposes and often means that untargeted algorithms
spend a lot of time picking peaks in data that's irrelevant. minifyMzml is a function designed to
"minify" mzML files by extracting only those data points that are within a ppm error of an m/z value
of interest, and returns the file essentially otherwise unchanged. This function currently works
only on MS1 data, but is reasonably expandable if demand becomes evident.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">minifyMzml(
  filename,
  output_filename,
  ppm,
  mz_exclude = NULL,
  mz_include = NULL,
  warn = TRUE,
  prefilter = -1
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>filename</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of a single file to be minified, usually produced by Proteowizard's 'msconvert'
or something similar.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>output_filename</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the file to be written out.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ppm</code></td>
<td>
<p>The parts-per-million error of the instrument used to collect the original file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mz_exclude</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of m/z values that should be excluded from the minified file. This argument
must be used with the 'ppm' argument and should not be used with mz_include. For each mass provided, an
m/z window of +/- 'ppm' is calculated, and all data points within that window are removed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mz_include</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of m/z values that should be included in the minified file. This argument
must be used with the 'ppm' argument and should not be used with mz_exclude. For each mass provided, an
m/z window of +/- 'ppm' is calculated, and all data points within that window are kept.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>warn</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean. Should the function warn the user when removing an index from an mzML file?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prefilter</code></td>
<td>
<p>A single number corresponding to the minimum intensity of
interest in the MS1 data. Data points with intensities below this threshold
will be silently dropped, which can dramatically reduce the size of the
final object. Currently only works with MS1 data, but could be expanded
easily to handle more.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Invisibly, the name of the new file.
