<h2>degreeMin</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Specifies the statistic for an 'degreeMin' effect in the tie-oriented
model with undirected events.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">degreeMin(scaling = c("none", "prop", "std"), consider_type = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scaling</code></td>
<td>
<p>the method for scaling the degree statistic. Default is
to not scale the statistic (scaling = "none"). Alternatively,
scaling of the raw degree counts by two times the number of past events at
time t can be requested with 'prop' or standardization of the raw degree
counts per time point can be requested with 'std'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>consider_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, indicates whether to count the degrees
separately for each event type (TRUE, default) or sum degrees across
different event types (FALSE).</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An degreeMin effect refers to the tendency for dyads to increase their
interaction rate if the total degree of the least active actor in the pair
increases. The statistic at timepoint <em>t</em> for dyad <em>(i,j)</em> is
equal to the minimum of the following two values: the number of events
before timepoint <em>t</em> that involved actor <em>i</em> and actor <em>j</em>,
respectively. Note that the degreeMin effect is only defined for undirected
events.
</p>
<p>Optionally, a scaling method can be set with <code>scaling</code>. By scaling the
degree count by the total number of past events, the statistic refers to the
fraction of past events that the least active actor was involved in. At the
first time point, when no events did previously occur, it is assumed that
every actor is equally likely to be involved in an event and the statistic
is set equal to 1/n, where n refers to the number of actors.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>List with all information required by 'remstats::remstats()' to compute the statistic.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>degreeDiff</code>, <code>degreeMax</code> or
<code>totaldegreeDyad</code> for other types of degree effects for
undirected events.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">reh_tie &lt;- remify::remify(history, model = "tie", directed = FALSE)
effects &lt;- ~ degreeMin()
remstats(reh = reh_tie, tie_effects = effects)

</code></pre>
