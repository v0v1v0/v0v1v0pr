<h2>Example data for the <span class="pkg">rsurface</span> package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This example uses experimental data published in Czitrom and Spagon (1997),
<em>Statistical Case Studies for Industrial Process Improvement</em> that
describes a semiconductor wafer processing experiment. A goal of this experiment
was to fit response surface models to the deposition layer stress
as a function of two particular controllable factors of the chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) reactor process. These factors were pressure (measured in torr)
and the ratio of the gaseous reactants hydrogen gas and tungsten(VI) fluoride.
