<h2>Determine the number of FPCs based on the share of explained variance</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This internal function is called in <code>gfpca_twoStep</code>, <code>fpca_gauss</code>
and <code>bfpca</code> to determine the number of functional principal components
based on their share of explained variance.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">determine_npc(evalues, npc_criterion)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>evalues</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of estimated variances of the FPC scores.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>npc_criterion</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either (i) a share between 0 and 1, or (ii) a vector with
two elements for the targeted explained share of variance and a cut-off scree
plot criterion, both between 0 and 1. For the latter, e.g.,
<code>npc_criterion = c(0.9,0.02)</code> tries to choose a number of FPCs that
explains at least 90% of variation, but only includes FPCs that explain at
least 2% of variation (even if this means 90% explained variation is not reached).</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Integer for the number of fucntional principal components
