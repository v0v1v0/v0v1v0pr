<h2>Study five of Rogers, T. &amp; Milkman, K. L. (2016). Reminders through association. Psychological Science, 27, 973-986.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Participants have to answer to many questions (in a 11-page-survey). For 5 questions (indicated by $$ at the beginning of the question), they are told that there is a correct answer and that they will earn $0.06 if they provide this correct answer.
At the beginning of the experiment, there are also told that they will earn a $0.60 bonus if they choose the answer E on the last question (whatever this is the correct answer or not).

<p>Condition 1 = free-reminder-through-association condition: participants read that they can choose to have (for free) an image of an elephant (presented on screen) that would appear at the bottom of page 11 as a reminder of selecting answer E;
Condition 2 = non condition: no reminders;
Condition 3 = costly-reminder-through-association condition: participants read that if they pay $0.03, an image of an elephant (presented on screen) would appear at the bottom of page 11 as a reminder of selecting answer E
Condition 4 = forced-reminder-through-association condition: participants read that an image of an elephant (presented on screen) would appear at the bottom of page 11 as a reminder of selecting answer E.
