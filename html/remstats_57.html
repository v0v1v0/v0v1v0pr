<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class 'remstats'. In case of the 
tie-oriented model, an array with the computed statistics, where rows refer 
to time points, columns refer to potential relational event (i.e., potential 
edges) in the risk set and slices refer to statistics. In case of the 
actor-oriented model, list with in the first element the statistics for the 
sender activity rate step and in the second element the statistics for the 
receiver choice step, where rows refer to time points, columns refer to 
potential senders or receivers, respectively. The 'remstats' object has the 
following attributes: 
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>model</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Type of model that is estimated, obtained from the 
remify object inputted to 'reh'.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>formula</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Model formula, obtained from the formula inputted 
to 'tie_effects', 'sender_effects' and/or 'receiver_effects', depending 
on the model.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>riskset</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>For the tie-oriented model, the risk set used to 
construct the statistics.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>actors</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>For the actor-oriented model, the set of actors 
used to construct the statistics, obtained from the remify object 
inputted to 'reh'.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>adjmat</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>[Optional], for the tie-oriented model, if 
"get_adjmat = TRUE", the matrix with the accumulated event weights for 
each time point (on the rows) and each dyad (in the columns).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Effects</h3>

<p>The statistics to be computed are defined symbolically and should be
supplied to the <code>tie_effects</code> (for the tie-oriented model), or
<code>sender_effects</code> and/or <code>receiver_effects</code> (for the actor-oriented
model) argument in the form <code>~ effects</code>. The terms are separated by +
operators. For example: <code>effects = ~ inertia() + otp()</code>. Interactions
between two effects can be included with * or : operators. For example:
<code>effects = ~ inertia():otp()</code>. A list of available effects
can be obtained with <code>tie_effects()</code> and
<code>actor_effects()</code>.
</p>
<p>The majority of the statistics can be scaled in some way, see
the documentation of the <code>scaling</code> argument in the separate effect
functions for more information on this.
</p>
<p>The majority of the statistics can account for the event type
included as a dependent variable, see the documentation of the
<code>consider_type</code> argument in the separate effect functions for more
information on this. Note that this option is only available for the
tie-oriented model.
</p>
<p>Note that events in the relational event history can be directed or
undirected. Some statistics are only defined for either directed or
undirected events (see the documentation of the statistics). Note that
undirected events are only available for the tie-oriented model.
</p>


<h3>attr_actors</h3>

<p>For the computation of the <em>exogenous</em> statistics an attributes 
object with the exogenous covariate information has to be supplied to the
<code>attr_actors</code> argument in either <code>remstats()</code> or in the separate
effect functions supplied to the <code>..._effects</code> arguments (e.g., see
<code>send</code>). This <code>attr_actors</code> object should be constructed as
follows: A dataframe with rows referring to the attribute value of actor
<em>i</em> at timepoint <em>t</em>. A 'name' column is required that contains the
actor name (corresponding to the actor names in the relational event
history). A 'time' column is required that contains the time when attributes
change (set to zero if none of the attributes vary over time). Subsequent
columns contain the attributes that are called in the specifications of
exogenous statistics (column name corresponding to the string supplied to
the <code>variable</code> argument in the effect function). Note that the
procedure for the exogenous effects ‘tie’ and ‘event’ deviates from this,
here the exogenous covariate information has to be specified in a different
way, see <code>tie</code> and <code>event</code>.
</p>


<h3>attr_dyads</h3>

<p>For the computation of the <em>dyad exogenous</em> statistics with 
<code>tie()</code>, an attributes object with the exogenous covariates information 
per dyad has to be supplied. This is a <code>data.frame</code> or <code>matrix</code> 
containing attribute information for dyads. If <code>attr_dyads</code> is a 
<code>data.frame</code>, the first two columns should represent "actor1" and 
"actor2" (for directed events, "actor1" corresponds to the sender, and 
"actor2" corresponds to the receiver). Additional columns can represent 
dyads' exogenous attributes. If attributes vary over time, include a column 
named "time". If <code>attr_dyads</code> is a <code>matrix</code>, the rows correspond 
to "actor1", columns to "actor2", and cells contain dyads' exogenous 
attributes.
</p>


<h3>Memory</h3>

<p>The default 'memory' setting is '"full"', which implies that at each time
point $t$ the entire event history before $t$ is included in the computation
of the statistics. Alternatively, when 'memory' is set to '"window"', only
the past event history within a given time window is considered (see
Mulders &amp; Leenders, 2019). This length of this time window is set by the
'memory_value' parameter. For example, when 'memory_value = 100' and 'memory
= "window"', at time point $t$ only the past events that happened at most
100 time units ago are included in the computation of the statistics.
A third option is to set 'memory' to '"interval"'. In this case, the past
event history within a given time interval is considered. For example, when
'"memory_value" = c(50, 100)' and 'memory = "window"', at time point $t$
only the past events that happened between 50 and 100 time units ago are
included in the computation of the statistics. Finally, the fourth option is
to set 'memory' to '"decay"'. In this case, the weight of the past event in
the computation of the statistics depend on the elapsed time between $t$ and
the past event. This weight is determined based on an exponential decay
function with half-life parameter 'memory_value' (see Brandes et al., 2009).
</p>


<h3>Event weights</h3>

<p>Note that if the relational event history contains a column that is named
“weight”, it is assumed that these affect the endogenous statistics. These
affect the computation of all endogenous statistics with a few exceptions
that follow logically from their definition (e.g., the recenyContinue
statistic does depend on time since the event and not on event weights).
</p>


<h3>Subset the event history using 'start' and 'stop'</h3>

<p>It is possible to compute statistics for a segment of the relational event 
sequence, based on the entire event history. This is done by specifying the 
'start' and 'stop' values as the indices for the first and last event times 
for which statistics are needed. For instance, setting 'start = 5' and 'stop 
= 5' calculates statistics for the 5th event in the relational event 
sequence, considering events 1-4 in the history. Note that in cases of 
simultaneous events with the 'method' set to 'pt' (per timepoint), 'start' 
and 'stop' should correspond to the indices of the first and last 
<em>unique</em> event timepoints for which statistics are needed. For example, 
if 'start = 5' and 'stop = 5', statistics are computed for the 5th unique 
timepoint in the relational event sequence, considering all events occurring 
at unique timepoints 1-4.
</p>


<h3>Adjacency matrix</h3>

<p>Optionally, a previously computed adjacency matrix can be supplied. Note
that the endogenous statistics will be computed based on this adjacency
matrix. Hence, supplying a previously computed adjacency matrix can reduce
computation time but the user should be absolutely sure the adjacency matrix
is accurate.
