<h2>Formatting RNG Information</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions retrieve/prints formated information about RNGs.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">RNGstr(object, n = 7L, ...)

RNGtype(object, ..., provider = FALSE)

showRNG(object = getRNG(), indent = "#", ...)

RNGinfo(object = getRNG(), ...)

RNGdigest(object = getRNG())
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>RNG seed (i.e. an integer vector), or an object that contains
embedded RNG data.
For <code>RNGtype</code> this must be either a valid RNG seed or a single integer that
must be a valid encoded RNG kind (see <code>RNGkind</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>maximum length for a seed to be showed in full.
If the seed has length greater than <code>n</code>, then only the first three elements
are shown and a digest hash of the complete seed is appended to the string.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>extra arguments passed to <code>RNGtype</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>provider</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical that indicates if the library that provides the RNG
should also be returned as an extra element.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>indent</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string to use as indentation prefix in the output
from <code>showRNG</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All functions can be called with objects that are – valid –
RNG seeds or contain embedded RNG data, but none of them change the current
RNG setting.
To effectively change the current settings on should use <code>setRNG</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a single character string
</p>
<p><code>RNGtype</code> returns a named character vector containing the types of the random number generator, which correspond
to the arguments accepted by base::RNGkind.
Note that starting with R 3.6, the vector has length 3, while in previous R versions it has length 2 (no sample.kind element).
</p>


<h3>Functions</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>RNGstr</code>: returns a description of an RNG seed as a single character string.
</p>
<p>It formats seeds by collapsing them in a comma separated string.
By default, seeds that contain more than 7L integers, have their 3 first values
collapsed plus a digest hash of the complete seed.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>RNGtype</code>: extract the kinds of RNG and Normal RNG.
</p>
<p>It returns the same type of values as <code>RNGkind()</code> (character strings),
except that it can extract the RNG settings from an object.
If <code>object</code> is missing it returns the kinds of the current RNG settings,
i.e. it is identical to <code>RNGkind()</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>showRNG</code>: displays human readable information about RNG settings.
If <code>object</code> is missing it displays information about the current RNG.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>RNGinfo</code>: is equivalent to <code>RNGtype</code> but returns a named
list instead of an unnamed character vector.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# default is a 626-long integer
RNGstr()
# what would be the seed after seeding with set.seed(1234)
RNGstr(1234)
# another RNG (short seed)
RNGstr(c(401L, 1L, 1L))
# no validity check is performed 
RNGstr(2:3)


# get RNG type
RNGtype()
RNGtype(provider=TRUE)
RNGtype(1:3)

# type from encoded RNG kind
RNGtype(107L)
# this is different from the following which treats 107 as a seed for set.seed
RNGtype(107)

showRNG()
# as after set.seed(1234)
showRNG(1234)
showRNG()
set.seed(1234)
showRNG()
# direct seeding
showRNG(1:3)
# this does not change the current RNG
showRNG()
showRNG(provider=TRUE)

# get info as a list
RNGinfo()
RNGinfo(provider=TRUE)
# from encoded RNG kind
RNGinfo(107)

# compute digest hash from RNG settings
RNGdigest()
RNGdigest(1234)
# no validity check is performed
RNGdigest(2:3)
