<h2>Computes the critical cost efficiency index</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The nonparametric tests of rationality axioms (<code>garp, sarp</code>, and <code>warp</code>) are "sharp" in nature.
This means that the tests will only tell us whether the observed data set passed the rationality axioms.
However, when the data set fails, it is often useful to know how close the observed behavior is to
satisfying the rationality restrictions (see Varian (1990) for an extensive motivation). Over the years, several
measures (called goodness-of-fit indices) have been introduced to evaluate the degree to which the data set is consistent
with the rationality axiom(s). The most popular goodness-of-fit index is the Critical Cost Efficiency Index;
CCEI (also known as the Afriat Efficiency Index; AEI) proposed by Afriat (1973). The CCEI is defined as the maximal value of
the efficiency level <code class="reqn">e</code> such that the data set is consistent with GARP. Intuitively, this measure indicates the degree
to which the set of demand observations is consistent with GARP. This function computes the CCEI following the binary
search algorithm described in Varian (1990). Optionally, the user can specify the axiom (WARP, SARP, or GARP) for which
the CCEI needs to be computed. When no axiom is specified, the function takes the default option as GARP.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ccei(p, q, model = "GARP")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code class="reqn">T X N</code> matrix of observed prices where each row corresponds to an observation
and each column corresponds to a consumption category. <code class="reqn">T</code> is the number of observations
and <code class="reqn">N</code> is the number of consumption categories.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>q</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code class="reqn">T X N</code> matrix of observed quantities where each row corresponds to an observation
and each column corresponds to a consumption category.<code class="reqn">T</code> is the number of observations
and <code class="reqn">N</code> is the number of consumption categories.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies which axiom (GARP, SARP, or WARP) should be used to compute the CCEI. The default value
is "GARP" which computes the usual CCEI (also known as the Afriat efficiency index, AEI) proposed by Afriat (1973).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns <code class="reqn">e^*</code> which is the highest efficiency level at which the data satisfy the
given axiom. For instance, if the given model is "GARP", the function returns the maximal value of the efficiency
level <code class="reqn">e</code> such that the data satisfy <code class="reqn">e</code>GARP.
