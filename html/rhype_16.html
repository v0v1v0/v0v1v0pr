<h2>Find the Incidence Matrix of a Hypergraph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An incidence matrix has rows indexed by vertices and columns indexed by
hyperedges. Each entry is non-zero if the associated vertex is a member of
the associated hyperedge. For an oriented hypergraph, this returns a list of
two matrices with the first representing incidence to one end of the
hyperedges and the second representing incidence to the other end. For a
directed hypergraph the first represents incidence to the tail of a
hyperedge and the second represents incidence to the head.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">incidence_matrix(hype, augment_oriented = TRUE, as_matrix = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hype</code></td>
<td>
<p>A hypergraph object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>augment_oriented</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to augment an oriented hypergraph</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>as_matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to coerce the result to a simple matrix</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It is hard to use the incidence matrices of oriented undirected hypergraphs
in calculations. The <code>augment_oriented</code> option turns the hypergraph into a
directed hypergraph, but each hyperedge is represented twice, once pointing
in each direction. This is much easier to use for further calculations.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An incidence matrix or a list of two incidence matrices.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">h1 &lt;- example_hype()
incidence_matrix(h1)

h2 &lt;- example_hype(oriented = TRUE, directed = TRUE)
incidence_matrix(h2)
</code></pre>
