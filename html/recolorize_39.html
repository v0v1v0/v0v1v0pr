<h2>Recluster color centers based on color similarity</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Color mapping (as with k-means or binning) often requires over-clustering in
order to recover details in an image. This can result in larger areas of
relatively uniform color being split into multiple colors, or in regions with
greater variation (due to lighting, shape, reflection, etc) being split into
multiple colors. This function clusters the color centers by visual
similarity (in CIE Lab space), then returns the re-clustered object. Users
can either set a similarity cutoff or a final number of colors. See examples.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">recluster(
  recolorize_obj,
  dist_method = "euclidean",
  hclust_method = "complete",
  channels = 1:3,
  color_space = "Lab",
  ref_white = "D65",
  cutoff = 60,
  n_final = NULL,
  plot_hclust = TRUE,
  refit_method = "impose",
  resid = FALSE,
  plot_final = TRUE,
  color_space_fit = "sRGB"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>recolorize_obj</code></td>
<td>
<p>A recolorize object from <code>recolorize</code>,
<code>recluster</code>, or <code>imposeColors</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dist_method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Method passed to stats::dist for calculating distances
between colors. One of "euclidean", "maximum", "manhattan", "canberra",
"binary" or "minkowski".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hclust_method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Method passed to stats::hclust for clustering colors
by similarity. One of "ward.D", "ward.D2", "single", "complete", "average"
(= UPGMA), "mcquitty" (= WPGMA), "median" (= WPGMC) or "centroid" (=
UPGMC).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>channels</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric: which color channels to use for clustering. Probably
some combination of 1, 2, and 3, e.g., to consider only luminance and
blue-yellow (b-channel) distance in CIE Lab space, channels = c(1, 3) (L
and b).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>color_space</code></td>
<td>
<p>Color space in which to cluster centers, passed to
<code>grDevices{convertColor}</code>. One of "sRGB", "Lab", or "Luv".
Default is "Lab", a perceptually uniform (for humans) color space.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ref_white</code></td>
<td>
<p>Reference white for converting to different color spaces.
D65 (the default) corresponds to standard daylight.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cutoff</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric similarity cutoff for grouping color centers
together. The range and value will depend on the chosen color space (see
below), but the default is in absolute Euclidean distance in CIE Lab space,
which means it is greater than 0-100, but cutoff values between 20 and 80
will usually work best. See details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n_final</code></td>
<td>
<p>Final number of desired colors; alternative to specifying
a similarity cutoff. Overrides <code>cutoff</code> if provided.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot_hclust</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Plot the hierarchical clustering tree for
color similarity? Helpful for troubleshooting a cutoff.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>refit_method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Method for refitting the image with the new color
centers. One of either "impose" or "merge". <code>imposeColors</code>
refits the original image using the new colors (slow but often better
results). <code>mergeLayers</code> merges the layers of the existing
recolored image. This is faster since it doesn't require a new fit, but can
produce messier results.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>resid</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Get final color fit residuals with
<code>colorResiduals</code>?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot_final</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Plot the final color fit?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>color_space_fit</code></td>
<td>
<p>Passed to <code>imposeColors</code>. What
color space should the image be reclustered in?</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is fairly straightforward: the RGB color centers of the
recolorize object are converted to CIE Lab color space (which is
approximately perceptually uniform for human vision), clustered using
<code>hclust</code>, then grouped using <code>cutree</code>.
The resulting groups are then passed as the assigned color centers to
<code>imposeColors</code>, which re-fits the <em>original</em> image using the new
centers.
</p>
<p>The similarity cutoff does not require the user to specify the final number
of colors, unlike k-means or <code>n_final</code>, meaning that the same cutoff could be
used for multiple images (with different numbers of colors) and produce
relatively good fits. Because the cutoff is in absolute Euclidean distance in
CIE Lab space for sRGB colors, the possible range of distances (and therefore
cutoffs) is from 0 to &gt;200. The higher the cutoff, the more dissimilar colors
will be grouped together. There is no universally recommended cutoff; the
same degree of color variation due to lighting in one image might be
biologically relevant in another.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>recolorize</code> object with the re-fit color centers.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># get an image
corbetti &lt;- system.file("extdata/corbetti.png", package = "recolorize")

# too many color centers
recolored_corbetti &lt;- recolorize(corbetti, bins = 2)

# just enough!
# check previous plot for clustering cutoff
recluster_obj &lt;- recluster(recolored_corbetti,
                           cutoff = 45,
                           plot_hclust = TRUE,
                           refit_method = "impose")

# we get the same result by specifying n_final = 5
recluster_obj &lt;- recluster(recolored_corbetti,
                           n_final = 5,
                           plot_hclust = TRUE)
