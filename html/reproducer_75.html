<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data set collected at Wroclaw University of Technology (POLAND) by Lech Madeyski includes separate entries for each abstract assessed by a judge, that is 4 entries for each judge. Data collected from 16 subjects recruited from Wroclaw  University of Technology who were each asked to assess 4 abstracts.
</p>
<p>Note Only completeness question 2 was expected to be context dependent and have a NA (not applicable)  answer, if other completeness answers were left blank, BAK coded the answer as NA
