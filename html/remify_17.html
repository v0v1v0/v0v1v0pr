<h2>plot.remify</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>several plots that describe the network of relational events, both for directed and undirected relational events.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'remify'
plot(
  x,
  which = c(1:5),
  breaks = 15L,
  palette = "Purples",
  n_intervals = 4L,
  rev = TRUE,
  actors = attr(x, "dictionary")$actors$actorName,
  pch.degree = 20,
  igraph.edge.color = "#4daa89",
  igraph.vertex.color = "#5AAFC8",
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<td>
<p>one or more numbers between 1 and 5. Plots described in order: (1) distribution of the inter-event times (histogram), (2) tile plot titled 'activity plot', with in-degree and out-degree activity line plots on the sides (or total-degree on the top side if the network is undirected). Tiles' color is scaled based on the count of the directed (or undirected) dyad, (3) for directed networks two plots of normalized out-degree and in-degree (values ranging in [0,1]) over a set of <code>n_intervals</code> (evenly spaced). For undirected networks one plot of normalized total-degree over the <code>n_intervals</code> (also here values ranging in [0,1]). The normalization is calculated in each interval as the <code>(degree-min(degree))/(max(degree)-min(degree)))</code> for each actor considering minimum and maximum degree (in-, out- or total-) observed in the interval (opacity and size of the points is proportional to the normalized measure), (4) four plots: (i) number of events (# events) per time interval, (ii) proportion of observed dyads (# dyads / x$D) per time interval, (iii) and (iv) (for directed network only) proportion of active senders and receivers per time interval (calculated as # senders/ x$N and # receiver/x$N per interval), (5) two networks: (i) network of events where edges are considered undirected (edges' opacity is proportional to the counts of the undirected events, vertices' opacity is proportional to the total-degree of the actors), (ii) visualization of directed network (edges' opacity is proportional to the counts of the directed events, vertices' opacity is proportional to the in-degree of the actors).</p>
