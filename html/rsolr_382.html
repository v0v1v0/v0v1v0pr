<h2>FieldInfo</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>FieldInfo</code> object is a vector of field entries from the Solr
schema. Typically, one retrieves an instance with <code>fields</code>
and shows it on the console to get an overview of the schema. The
vector-like nature means that functions like <code>[</code>  and
<code>length</code> behave as expected.
</p>


<h3>Accessors</h3>

<p>These functions get the “columns” from the field information
“table”:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>name(x)</code>: Gets the name of the field.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>typeName(x)</code>: Gets the name of the field type, see
<code>fieldTypes</code>.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>dynamic(x)</code>: Gets whether the field is dynamic, i.e.,
whether its name is treated as a wildcard glob. If a document
field does not match a static field name, it takes its
properties from the first dynamic field (in schema order) that it
matches.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>multiValued(x)</code>: Gets whether the field accepts multiple
values. A multi-valued field is manifested in R as a list.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>required(x)</code>: Gets whether the field must have a value in
every document. A non-required field will sometimes have NAs. This
is useful for both ensuring data integrity and optimizations.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>indexed(x)</code>: Gets whether the field has been indexed. A
field must be indexed for us to filter by it. Faceting requires a
field to be indexed or have doc values.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>stored(x)</code>: Gets whether the data for a field have been
stored in the database. We can search on any (indexed) field, but
we can only retrieve data from stored fields.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>docValues(x)</code>: Gets whether the data have been additionally
stored in a columnar format that accelerates Solr function calls
(<code>transform</code>) and faceting (<code>aggregate</code>).

</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Utilities</h3>


<ul><li>
<p><code>x %in% table</code>: Returns whether each field name in <code>x</code>
matches a field defined in <code>table</code>, a <code>FieldInfo</code>
object. This convenience is particularly needed when the schema
contains dynamic fields.

</p>
</li></ul>
