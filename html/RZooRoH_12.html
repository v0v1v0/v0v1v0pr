<h2>Extracts the realized autozygosity from the zres object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

performed for the indicated classes (all by default) and names are added to
the columns. The function must be used with more than one individual is the
zres object.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">realized(zres, classNum = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>zres</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the zres object created by the zoorun function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>classNum</code></td>
<td>
<p>An array with the number of the classes to extract. All

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a data frame with one row per individual and one
column per extracted classes. In addition, it gives names to the columns.
For a pre-defined model, the names of HBD classes are "R_X" where X is the
rate of the corresponding class. For a model with rate estimation, the names
of the HBD classes are "HBDclassX" where X is the number of the HBD class.
For non-HBD classes, we use "NonHBD".
