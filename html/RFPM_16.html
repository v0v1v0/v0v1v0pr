<h2>Floating Percentile Model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Floating Percentile Model and supporting functions to inform and improve sediment benchmark development
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">RFPM()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>'RFPM' is an open-source implementation of the floating percentile model (FPM), which was
originally developed by Avocet (2003) using Visual Basic for Applications and distributed to US Pacific Northwest regulatory agencies as a
Microsoft Excel-based tool. 'RFPM' was developed independently by Claire Detering and Brian Church with
support from John Toll and others at Windward Environmental LLC.
</p>
<p>The purpose of the FPM is to generate aquatic toxicity-based sediment quality benchmarks
for management of contaminated freshwater sediment sites. These benchmarks are intended to act as classification thresholds,
meaning that an exceedance of benchmarks would imply that toxicity (as categorically defined) is likely in the sediment sample.
The FPM has been used at sites in the US Pacific Northwest for many years, particularly after being published by the
Washington State Department of Ecology in 2011.
</p>
<p>The primary function in 'RFPM' is <code>FPM</code>, which runs the FPM algorithm on a data.frame object that includes concentrations of
chemicals in sediment as well as a logical toxicity classification column called "Hit". Example datasets are provided. The output of <code>FPM</code>
includes a set of sediment quality benchmarks for chemicals with significantly higher concentrations when <code>Hit == TRUE</code>
than when <code>Hit == FALSE</code>. Plots comparing the <code>Hit == TRUE</code> and <code>Hit == FALSE</code> data can also
be generated as a diagnostic tool. Supplemental functions (e.g., <code>optimFPM</code>) can help to optimize <code>FPM</code> inputs (resulting in more accurate benchmarks) or evaluate
the relative importance of each chemical among the FPM benchmarks (i.e., <code>chemVI</code>).
</p>
<p>For 'RFPM', the <code>FPM</code> algorithm has been changed from the original Avocet (2003) model. Key changes are as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> A decision tree is implemented to select statistically appropriate hypothesis tests for chemical selection. This can be overridden if the
original Excel-based tool method is desired; see <code>?chemSig</code> for details. The chemical selection and FPM algorithm have been integrated into <code>FPM</code>, though chemical selection can still be run separately, if desired.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The iterative looping of the FPM algorithm over multiple false negative limits was
not included in <code>FPM</code>. We find this functionality of the Excel-based tool to be confusing and unnecessary.
Instead, we believe the results generated for different false negative limits should be independently generated rather than dependent on prior model runs.
Thus, <code>FPM</code> allows for multiple false negative limits to be input in a seqeuential but independent manner, resulting in a data.frame of benchmarks with one
row per false negative limit. In R terminology, <code>FPM</code> has been vectorized.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> An optimization function called <code>optimFPM</code> was developed to optimize the overall reliability of FPM sediment quality benchmarks. Different optimization metrics are provided, and a weight of evidence should be considered when selecting inputs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A function was developed to quickly calculate chemical "variable importance" statistics using <code>chemVI</code>. These statistics
can inform the user about the influence of specific chemicals over the set of FPM benchmarks and, for example,
whether certain benchmarks can be ignored without a significant loss of predictive ability.
