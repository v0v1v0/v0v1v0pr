<h2>Internet ping times</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In Spring 2000 a team measured ping times of Internet servers at various
</p>
<p>distances from Raleigh using a software program called NeoTrace. They
</p>
<p>actually measured ping times at 4 different times of the day, but since
</p>
<p>there was very little difference over time, we have averaged over the
</p>
<p>times of day.
</p>
