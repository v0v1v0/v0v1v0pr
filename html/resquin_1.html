<h2>Compute response distribution indicators</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute response distribution indicators for responses to multi-item scales or matrix
questions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">resp_distributions(x, min_valid_responses = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing survey responses in wide format. For more information
see section "Data requirements" below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min_valid_responses</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric between 0 and 1. Defines the share of valid responses
a respondent must have to calculate response quality indicators. Default is 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following response distribution indicators are calculated per respondent:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> n_na: number of intra-individual missing answers
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> prop_na: proportion of intra-individual missing responses
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ii_mean: intra-individual mean
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ii_median: intra-individual median
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ii_sd:  intra-individual standard deviation
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> mahal: mahalanobis distance per respondent.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Intra-individual response variability (ii_sd) has been
proposed to measure insufficient effort responding (Dunn et al., 2018) and to
distinguish between random and conscientious responding (Marjanovic et al, 2015).
</p>
<p>Intra-individual location indicators can be used to asses the average location
of responses on a set of questions (ii_mean, ii_median).
</p>
<p>Mahalanobis distance is a outlier detection indicator. It represents the distance
of a participants responses from the center of a multivariate normal distribution
defined by the data of all respondents.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a data frame with response quality indicators per respondent.
Dimensions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Rows: Equal to number of rows in x.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Columns: Six, one for each response distribution indicator.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data requirements</h3>

<p><code>resp_distributions()</code> assumes that data comes from multi-item scales or matrix questions,
which have the same number and labeling of response options for many questions.
The input data frame must be structured in the following way:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The data frame is in wide format, meaning each row represents one respondent, each
column represents one variable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> All responses have integer values.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Missing values are set to <code>NA</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reverse coding of variables</h3>

<p>The interpretation of the indicators depends on the whether response
data of negatively worded questions was reversed or not:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Do not reverse data of negatively worded questions if you want to assess
average response patterns (Dunn et al., 2018).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Reverse data of negatively worded questions if you want to assess whether
responses are distributed randomly or not with respect to an assumed
latent variable (Marjanovic et al., 2015).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mahalanobis distance could not be calculated</h3>

<p>Under certain circumstances, the mahalanobis distance can not be calculated.
This may be if there is high collinearity (correlation between variables) or
if there are to many missing values.
Although this can happen in survey research data, this message can also
indicate that something in the data is "off" due to one of the reasons stated
above. A manual inspection for low-quality responses can be a next step.
