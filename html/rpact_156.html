<p>Parameter Description: Allocation Ratio Planned
</p>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>allocationRatioPlanned</code></td>
<td>
<p>The planned allocation ratio <code>n1 / n2</code> for a two treatment groups
design, default is <code>1</code>. For multi-arm designs, it is the allocation ratio relating the active arm(s) to the control.
For simulating means and rates for a two treatment groups design, it can be a vector of length <code>kMax</code>, the number of stages.
It can be a vector of length kMax, too, for multi-arm and enrichment designs.
In these cases, a change of allocating subjects to treatment groups over the stages can be assessed.
Note that internally <code>allocationRatioPlanned</code> is treated as a vector of length <code>kMax</code>, not a scalar.</p>
