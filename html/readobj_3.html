<h2>Wrapper for tiny_obj_loader single file C++ library</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides fast reading of Wavefront OBJ files with support for
some material properties using the
<a href="https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader">tinyobjloader</a> C++
library. It is noticeably faster than the pure R <code>readOBJ</code>
implemented in the <code>rgl</code> package.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note that the rgl package does provide a <code>writeOBJ</code>
function, whereas this library only focusses on fast reading of OBJ files.
</p>
<p>As of readobj v0.4 released in June 2021, tinyobjloader was updated tag
v1.0.7; this was after considering and rejecting the 2.0 series where between
2.0 rc3 and rc4 a default diffuse value was added. This update means that the
internal structure of more complex meshes has changed.
