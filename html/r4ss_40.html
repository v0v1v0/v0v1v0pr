<h2>Apply Francis composition weighting method TA1.8 for conditional age-at-length fits</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uses an extension of method TA1.8 (described in Appendix A of Francis, 2011)
to do stage-2 weighting of conditional age at length composition data from a
Stock Synthesis model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SSMethod.Cond.TA1.8(
  fit,
  fleet,
  part = 0:2,
  seas = NULL,
  plotit = TRUE,
  printit = FALSE,
  datonly = FALSE,
  plotadj = !datonly,
  maxpanel = 1000,
  FullDiagOut = FALSE,
  ShowVersionB = FALSE,
  fleetnames = NULL,
  add = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fit</code></td>
<td>
<p>Stock Synthesis output as read by r4SS function SS_output</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fleet</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of one or more fleet numbers whose data are to
be analysed simultaneously (the output N multiplier applies
to all fleets combined)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>part</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of one or more partition values; analysis is restricted
to composition data with one of these partition values.
Default is to include all partition values (0, 1, 2).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>seas</code></td>
<td>
<p>string indicating how to treat data from multiple seasons
'comb' - combine seasonal data for each year and plot against Yr
'sep' - treat seasons separately, plotting against Yr.S
If is.null(seas) it is assumed that there is only one season in
the selected data (a warning is output if this is not true) and
option 'comb' is used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plotit</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE, make an illustrative plot like one or more
panels of Fig. 4 in Francis (2011).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>printit</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE, print results to R console.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>datonly</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE, don't show the model expectations</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plotadj</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE, plot the confidence intervals associated with
the adjusted sample sizes (TRUE by default unless datonly = TRUE)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxpanel</code></td>
<td>
<p>maximum number of panels within a plot</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>FullDiagOut</code></td>
<td>
<p>Print full diagnostics?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ShowVersionB</code></td>
<td>
<p>Report the Version B value in addition to the default?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fleetnames</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of alternative fleet names to draw from for
plot titles and captions. It should have length equal to the number
of fleets in the model, not the number of fleets considered in this function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>add</code></td>
<td>
<p>add to existing plot</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function outputs a multiplier, <em>w</em>,
(with bootstrap 95% confidence intervals) so that
<em>N2i</em> = <em>w</em> x <em>N1i</em>,
where <em>N1i</em> and <em>N2i</em> are the stage-1 and stage-2 multinomial
sample sizes for the <em>i</em>th composition. Optionally makes a plot
of observed and expected mean ages, with two alternative
sets of confidence limits - based on <em>N1i</em> (thin lines) and <em>N2i</em>
(thick lines) - for the observed values.
</p>
<p>This function formerly reported two versions of w differ according to whether
the calculated mean ages are
indexed by year (version A) or by year and length bin (version B).
However, research by Punt (2015) found Version A to perform better and
version B is no longer recommended and is only reported if requested by the user.
</p>
<p>CAUTIONARY/EXPLANATORY NOTE. The large number of options available in SS makes it
very difficult to be sure that what this function does is appropriate for all
combinations of options. The following notes (for version A) might help anyone
wanting to check or correct the code.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> The code first removes unneeded rows
from database condbase.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The remaining rows of the database are grouped
(indexed by vector indx) and relevant statistics (e.g., observed and expected
mean age), and ancillary data, are calculated for each group (these are stored
in pldat - one row per group).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If the data are to be plotted they are further
grouped by fleet, with one panel of the plot per fleet.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A single multiplier, <em>w</em>, is calculated to apply to all the
selected data.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
