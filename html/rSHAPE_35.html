<h2>This function is used to find which elements of a population matrix are deemed as established.  Established is determined
by having a number of individuals greater than or equal to a definable proportion of the summed community size.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is used to find which elements of a population matrix are deemed as established.  Established is determined
by having a number of individuals greater than or equal to a definable proportion of the summed community size.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">querryEstablished(func_inMatrix, func_sizeCol = "popSize",
  func_fitCol = "fitness", func_estProp = 0.01)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func_inMatrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is a matrix which must contain at least one column named as func_sizeCol which contains
the number of individuals in the communities' populations.  But it may also be required to include a column
func_fitCol if func_estProp is "Desai".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func_sizeCol</code></td>
<td>
<p>DO NOT MODIFY - this is the column name that is querried to find population sizes</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func_fitCol</code></td>
<td>
<p>DO NOT MODIFY - this is the column name that is querried to find population fitness -
only important if func_estProp is set to "Desai"</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func_estProp</code></td>
<td>
<p>If this value is less than 1 - This is the proportion of the current community size which
is used to define a population as established it returns the rows of.  If this value is greater than 1, it is
the minimum number of individuals required before a population is considered as established.
Lastly, it can be the character string "Desai", at which point - as per Desai 2007 - a lineage is established
once it has 1/s individuals.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A subset form of the input func_inMatrix matrix object containing the populations which are calculated
as established.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>There is no example as this cannot work outisde of a runSHAPE call, it requires data produced by the simulation experiment.
