<h2>stdyInfo and its child nodes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>stdyInfo is the study scope. It contains information about the data
collection's scope across several dimensions, including substantive content,
geography, and time. More information on these elements, especially their
allowed attributes, can be found in the references.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ddi_stdyInfo(...)

ddi_abstract(...)

ddi_studyBudget(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><em>Parent nodes</em>
</p>
<p><code>stdyInfo</code> is contained in <code>stdyDscr</code>.
</p>
<p><em>stdyInfo specific child nodes</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>ddi_abstract()</code> is an unformatted summary describing the purpose, nature,
and scope of the data collection, special characteristics of its contents,
major subject areas covered, and what questions the PIs attempted to answer
when they conducted the study. A listing of major variables in the study is
important here. In cases where a codebook contains more than one abstract
(for example, one might be supplied by the data producer and another
prepared by the data archive where the data are deposited), the "source"
and "date" attributes may be used to distinguish the abstract versions. Maps
to Dublin Core Description element. Inclusion of this element in the
codebook is recommended. The "date" attribute should follow ISO convention
of YYYY-MM-DD.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ddi_studyBudget()</code>is used to describe the budget of the project in as
much detail as needed.
</p>
</li>
