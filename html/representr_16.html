<h2>representr: A package for creating representative records post-record linkage.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The representr package provides two types of representative record generation:
point prototyping and posterior prototyping.
</p>


<h3>Point Prototyping</h3>

<p>To bridge the gap between record linkage and a downstream task, there are three methods to choose
or create the representative records from linked data: random prototyping, minimax prototyping, and
composite. These are all based on a point estimate of the linkage structure post-record linkage (
rather than a posterior distribution).
</p>
<p><b>Random prototyping</b> chooses a record from each cluster at random, either uniformly or according
to a supplied distribution. <b>Minimax prototyping</b> selects the record whose farthest neighbors
within the cluster is closest, based on some notion of closeness that is measured by a record distance
function. There are two distance functions included in this package (binary and
column-based), or the user can specify their own. <b>Composite</b> record
creation constructs the representative record by aggregating the records (in each cluster) to form
a composite record that includes information from each linked record.
</p>
<p>Each of these three types of prototyping can be used from the function represent.
</p>


<h3>Posterior prototyping</h3>

<p>The posterior distribution of the linkage can be used in two ways in this package. The first, is as
weights or in a distance function for the above point prototyping methods. The second, is through
the posterior prototyping (PP) weights presented in Kaplan, Betancourt, and Steorts (2018+). The PP
weights are accessible through the pp_weights function.
