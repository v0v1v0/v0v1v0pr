<h2>Star Trek series.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data frame with 35 rows and 3 columns containing names and abbreviations of
Star Trek series and anthologies. There are so many because the table
pertains to written works, which is inclusive of the more limited televised
series.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">stSeries
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Some entries listed as series can be interpreted as miniseries, but that
distinction is not made here. The official line between the two is not always
clear and can also change as more novels are released.
</p>
<p>Anthologies are listed as such, rather than as series. Reference manuals have
a distinct entry. The Miscellaneous category can be considered synonymous
with All-Series/Crossover, abbreviated elsewhere as simply <code>ST</code> for Star Trek
in general, rather than as <code>MISC</code>.
