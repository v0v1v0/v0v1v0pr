<h2>Calculate time to reach quasi-stationary stage distribution</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the time for a cohort projected with a matrix population
model to reach a defined quasi-stationary stage distribution.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">qsd_converge(mat, start = 1L, conv = 0.01, N = 100000L)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mat</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix population model, or component thereof (i.e., a square
projection matrix). Optionally with named rows and columns indicating the
corresponding life stage names.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>start</code></td>
<td>
<p>The index (or stage name) of the first stage at which the author
considers the beginning of life. Defaults to <code>1</code>. Alternately, a
numeric vector giving the starting population vector (in which case
<code>length(start)</code> must match <code>ncol(matU))</code>. See section
<em>Starting from multiple stages</em>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>conv</code></td>
<td>
<p>Proportional distance threshold from the stationary stage
distribution indicating convergence. For example, this value should be
<code>0.01</code> if the user wants to obtain the time step when the stage
distribution is within a distance of 1% of the stationary stage
distribution.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>N</code></td>
<td>
<p>Maximum number of time steps over which the population will be
projected. Time steps are in the same units as the matrix population model
(see <code>AnnualPeriodicity</code> column in COM(P)ADRE metadata). Defaults to
<code>100,000</code>.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Some matrix population models are parameterised with a stasis loop at the
largest/most-developed stage class, which can lead to artefactual plateaus
in the mortality or fertility trajectories derived from such models. These
plateaus occur as a projected cohort approaches its stationary stage
distribution (SSD). Though there is generally no single time point at which
the SSD is reached, we can define a quasi-stationary stage distribution (QSD)
based on a given distance threshold from the SSD, and calculate the number of
time steps required for a cohort to reach the QSD. This quantity can then be
used to subset age trajectories of mortality or fertility to periods earlier
than the QSD, so as to avoid artefactual plateaus in mortality or fertility.
</p>
<p><strong>Starting from multiple stages</strong>
</p>
<p>Rather than specifying argument <code>start</code> as a single stage class from
which all individuals start life, it may sometimes be desirable to allow for
multiple starting stage classes. For example, if we want to start our
calculation of QSD from reproductive maturity (i.e., first reproduction), we
should account for the possibility that there may be multiple stage classes
in which an individual could first reproduce.
</p>
<p>To specify multiple starting stage classes, specify argument <code>start</code> as
the desired starting population vector, giving the proportion
of individuals starting in each stage class (the length of <code>start</code>
should match the number of columns in the relevant MPM).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An integer indicating the first time step at which the
quasi-stationary stage distribution is reached (or an <code>NA</code> and a
warning if the quasi-stationary distribution is not reached).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The time required for a cohort to reach its QSD depends on the initial
population vector of the cohort (for our purposes, the starting stage
class), and so does not fundamentally require an ergodic matrix (where the
long-term equilibrium traits are independent of the initial population
vector). However, methods for efficiently calculating the stationary stage
distribution (SSD) generally do require ergodicity.
</p>
<p>If the supplied matrix (<code>mat</code>) is non-ergodic, <code>qsd_converge</code>
first checks for stage classes with no connection (of any degree) from the
starting stage class specified by argument <code>start</code>, and strips such
stages from the matrix. These unconnected stages have no impact on
age-specific traits that we might derive from the matrix (given the
specified starting stage), but often lead to non-ergodicity and therefore
prevent the reliable calculation of SSD. If the reduced matrix is ergodic,
the function internally updates the starting stage class and continues with
the regular calculation. Otherwise, if the matrix cannot be made ergodic,
the function will return <code>NA</code> with a warning.
