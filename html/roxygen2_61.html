<h2>Escape examples</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This documentation topic is used primarily for testing and to record
our understanding of the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠\example{}⁠</code> escaping rules.
See <a href="https://developer.r-project.org/parseRd.pdf">https://developer.r-project.org/parseRd.pdf</a> for the details provided
by R core.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">escape_examples(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># In examples we automatically escape Rd comments (%):
100 %% 30
# even if they are in strings
"50%"

# and \ and \v inside of strings and symbols
"\v" # vertical tab
"\\"
# but not comments: \l \v

# other string escapes are left as is
"\""
"\n"

# Otherwise, backslashes and parentheses are left as is. This
# means that you need to escape unbalanced parentheses, which typically only
# occur in \dontshow{}:

print("Hello")


# You also need to escape backslashes in infix operators and comments
# (this is generally rare)
`%\\%` &lt;- function(x, y) x + y
10 %\% 20
# \\ (renders as two backslashes)
</code></pre>
