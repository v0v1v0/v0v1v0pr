<h2>
<code>rquery</code>: Relational Query Generator for Data Manipulation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>rquery</code> supplies a piped query generator based on Edgar F. Codd's relational
algebra and operator names (plus experience using <code>SQL</code> and <code>dplyr</code> at big data
scale).  The design represents an attempt to make <code>SQL</code> more teachable by
denoting composition a sequential pipeline notation instead of nested
queries or functions.  Package features include: data processing trees
or pipelines as observable objects (able to report both columns
produced and columns used), optimized <code>SQL</code> generation as an explicit
user visible modeling step, and convenience methods for applying query
trees to in-memory data.frames.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note: <code>rquery</code> is a "database first" design.  This means choices are made that
favor database implementation. These include: capturing the entire calculation prior
to doing any work (and using recursive methods to inspect this object, which can limit
the calculation depth to under 1000 steps at a time), preferring "tame column names"
(which isn't a bad idea in 'R' anyway as columns and variables are often seen as cousins),
and not preserving row or column order (or supporting numeric column indexing).  Also,
<code>rquery</code> does have a fast in-memory implementation: <code>rqdatatable</code>
(thanks to the <code>data.table</code>, so one can in fact use 'rquery' without a database.
