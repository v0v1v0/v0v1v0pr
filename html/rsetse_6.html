<h2>A simple network made of three bi-connected components</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data set can be used to explore simple different embeddings methods on a very simple graph
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">biconnected_network
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An igraph network with 7 nodes and 19 edges which forms three biconnected components:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>edge_name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the edge connecting the two vertices</p>
</dd>
<dt>weight</dt>
<dd>
<p>The edge weight connecting the two vertices. This value is 1000 for edges connecting nodes
A to D, it is 500 for edges connecting nodes E to G, it is 100 connecting nodes D and E</p>
</dd>
<dt>force</dt>
<dd>
<p>The force produced by each node. It was calculated by subtracting the mean node centrality for the network
from the node centrality</p>
</dd>
<dt>group</dt>
<dd>
<p>The group each node is in. This can be used to generate force if required</p>
</dd>
</dl>
