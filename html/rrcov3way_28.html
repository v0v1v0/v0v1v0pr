<h2>
Parental behaviour in Japan
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data are drawn from a study (Kojima, 1975) of the perception of 
parental behaviour by parents and their children. Two data sets, boys and girls are available
as Kojima.boys and Kojima.girls. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Boys data were analysed in Kroonenberg (2008)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Girls data were analysed in Kroonenberg, Harshman, &amp; Murakami (2009).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(Kojima)

</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Both data sets are three dimensional arrays:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> boys: 150 x 18 x 4
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> girls: 153 x 18 x 4
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The rows (1st mode) are 150 Japanese sons/153 Japanese daughters.
The columns (2nd mode) are 18 scales (Acceptance, Child centerness, Possesiveness, etc.).
The slices (3rd mode) are the 4 judgements (See Details for explanation).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>boys</code> data are ratings expressing the judgments of parents with respect to their 
own behaviour toward their sons, and the judgments of their sons with respect to their 
parents. Thus, there are four conditions: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Father-Own behaviour (F-F), 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Mother-Own behaviour (M-M), 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Son-Father (B-F), 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Son-Mother (B-M). 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The judgments involved 150 middle-class Japanese eighth-grade boys on the 18 subscales of the inventory. 
Thus, the data set consists of a 150 (Sons) x 18 (scales) x 4 (judgment combinations) 
data array.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the girls data are ratings expressing the judgments of parents with respect to 
their own behaviour toward their daughters, and the judgments of their daughters with 
respect to their parents. Thus, there are four conditions: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Father-Own behaviour (F-F), 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Mother-Own behaviour (M-M),
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Daughter-Father (G-F), 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Daughter-Mother (G-M).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The judgments involved 153 middle-class Japanese eighth-grade girls on the 18 subscales of 
the inventory. Thus, the data set consists of a 153 (Daughters) x 18 (scales) x 4 (judgment combinations) 
data array.
</p>
<p><em>Preprocessing</em>
Given that the data are three-way profile data they are treated in the standard manner:
centering per occasion-variable combination and by normalising the data after centring 
per lateral slice i.e. per scale over all sons/daughters x judges combinations. 
For details see Kroonenberg (2008), Chapter 13.
