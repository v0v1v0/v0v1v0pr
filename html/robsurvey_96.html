<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>workplace</code> data represent a sample of workplaces in the
retail sector in a Canadian province. The data are <em>not</em> those
collected by Statistics Canada, but have been generated by Fuller
(2009, Example 3.1.1) to display similar characteristics to the
original 1999 Canadian Workplace and Employee Survey (WES).
</p>


<h4>Sampling design of the 1999 WES</h4>

<p>The WES target population is defined as all workplaces operating in
Canada with paid employees. The sampling frame is stratified by
industry, geographic region, and size (size is defined using
estimated employment). A sample of workplaces has been drawn
independently in each stratum using simple random sample without
replacement (the stratum-specific sample sizes are determined
by Neyman allocation).
Several strata containing very large workplaces were sampled
exhaustively; see Patak et al (1998). The original sampling weights
were adjusted for nonresponse.
</p>



<h4>Remarks by Fuller (2009, p. 365)</h4>

<p>The original weights of WES
were about 2200 for the stratum of small workplaces, about 750 for
medium-sized, and about 35 for large workspaces.</p>
