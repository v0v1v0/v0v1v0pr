<h2>Single exposure</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An S3 class <code>single_exposure</code> to represent exposure of data to <strong>one</strong> rule
pack. It is a list of the following structure: <code>pack_info</code> - single
pack_info object; <code>report</code> - tidy data validation report
without column <code>pack</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Single exposure is implemented in order to encapsulate preliminary
exposure data from single rule pack. It is needed to impute possibly missing
pack names during exposure. That is why <code>single_exposure</code> doesn't
contain pack name in any form.
