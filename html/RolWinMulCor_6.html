<h2>Estimate the Rolling Window Multiple Correlation 
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>'RolWinMulCor' estimates the rolling (running) window correlation for 
the bi- and multi-variate cases between regular (sampled on identical 
time points) time series, with especial emphasis to ecological data 
although this can be applied to other kinds of data sets. 'RolWinMulCor' 
is based on the concept of rolling, running, or sliding window correlation 
and is useful to evaluate the evolution of correlation through time and 
time-scales. 'RolWinMulCor' contains six (four for estimations and two 
for plots) functions. The first two functions focus on the bi-variate 
case: (1) 'rolwincor_1win' and (2) 'rolwincor_heatmap', which estimate the
correlation coefficients and their respective p-values for only one 
window-length (time-scale) and considering all possible window-lengths 
or a band of window-lengths, respectively. The second two functions: (3) 
'rolwinmulcor_1win' and (4) 'rolwinmulcor_heatmap' are designed to analyze 
the multi-variate case, following the bi-variate case to visually display 
the results, but these two approaches are methodologically different. 
That is, the multi-variate case estimate the adjusted coefficients of 
determination instead of the correlation coefficients. The last two 
functions: (5) 'plot_1win' and (6) 'plot_heatmap' are used to plot the 
time series under study and to represent graphically the outputs of the 
four aforementioned functions as simple plots or as heat maps. The six 
functions contained in 'RolWinMulCor' are highly flexible since these 
contain several parameters to control the estimation of correlation and 
the features of the plot output, e.g. to remove the linear trend 
contained in the time series under analysis, to choose different 
p-value correction methods (which are used to address the multiple 
comparison problem) or to personalise the plot output. The 'RolWinMulCor' 
package also provides examples with synthetic and real-life ecological 
time series to exemplify its use.

<p>RolWinMulCor package contains six functions: (1) <code>rolwincor_1win</code> estimates the rolling window correlation coefficients and their respective p-values for the bi-variate case for only one window-length or time-scale for the time series under study; (2) <code>rolwincor_heatmap</code> estimates the correlation coefficients and their corresponding p-values taking into account all the possible window-lengths that are determined by the number of elements of the time series under analysis or a band of window-lengths; (3) <code>rolwinmulcor_1win</code> estimates the rolling window correlation coefficients and their p-values for the multi-variate case for only one window-length or time-scale for the time series under study; (4) <code>rolwinmulcor_heatmap</code> estimates the correlation coefficients and their corresponding p-values for the multi-variate case taking into account all the possible window-lengths or a band of window-lengths; (5) <code>plot_1win</code> plots the time times under analysis and the correlation coefficients and their respective p-values (corrected or not corrected) as only one selected window-length using the outputs of the functions <code>rolwincor_1win</code> (bi-variate case) and <code>rolwinmulcor_1win</code> (multi-variate case); and (6) <code>plot_heatmap</code> plots the time series under scrutiny and the heat map for the correlation coefficients and their respective p-values (corrected or not corrected) for all possible window-lengths (i.e., from five to the number of elements of the time series under analysis) or for a band of window-lengths using the outputs of the functions <code>rolwincor_heatmap</code> (bi-variate case) and <code>rolwinmulcor_heatmap</code> (multi-variate case). The bi-variate case follow from a methodological point of view to Telford (2013), Polanco-Martínez (2019), and Polanco-Martínez (2020) whereas the multi-variate case follow to Abdi (2007) and Polanco-Martínez (2020).
