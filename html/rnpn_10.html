<h2>Download Individual Phenometrics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows for a parameterized search of all individual phenometrics records in the USA-NPN database, returning all records as per the search parameters in a
data table. Data fetched from NPN services is returned as raw JSON before being channeled into a data table. Optionally results can be directed to an output file in
which case raw JSON is converted to CSV and saved to file; in that case, data is also streamed to file which allows for more easily handling of the data if the search otherwise
returns more data than can be handled at once in memory.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This data type includes estimates of the dates of phenophase onsets and ends for individual plants and for animal species at a site during a user-defined time
period. Each row represents a series of consecutive "yes" phenophase status records, beginning with the date of the first "yes" and ending with the date of
the last "yes", submitted for a given phenophase on a given organism. Note that more than one consecutive series for an organism may be present within a single
growing season or year.
</p>
<p>Most search parameters are optional, however, users are encouraged to supply additional search parameters to get results that are easier to work with. Request_Source
must be provided. This is a self-identifying string, telling the service who is asking for the data or from where the request is being made. It is recommended
you provide your name or organization name. If the call to this function is acting as an intermediary for a client, then you may also optionally provide
a user email and/or IP address for usage data reporting later.
</p>
<p>Additional fields provides the ability to specify additional, non-critical fields to include in the search results. A complete list of additional fields can be found in
the NPN service's companion documentation
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yNjupricKOAXn6tY1sI7-EwkcfwdGUZ7lxYv7fcPjO8/edit#heading=h.7yy4i3278v7u
Metadata on all fields can be found in the following Excel sheet:

</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Data table of all status records returned as per the search parameters. Null if output directed to file.
