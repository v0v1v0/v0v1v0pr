<h2>Generate correlated data (predictors) for one unit</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is used to generate data for one unit. It is recently
re-designed to serve as a building block in a multi-level data
simulation exercise.  The new arguments "unit" and "idx" can be
set as NULL to remove the multi-level unit and row naming
features.  This function uses the rockchalk::mvrnorm function, but
introduces a convenience layer by allowing users to supply
standard deviations and the correlation matrix rather than the
variance.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">genX(
  N,
  means,
  sds,
  rho,
  Sigma = NULL,
  intercept = TRUE,
  col.names = NULL,
  unit = NULL,
  idx = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>N</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of cases desired</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>means</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of means for p variables. It is optional to
name them.  This implicitly sets the dimension of the
predictor matrix as N x p. If no names are supplied, the
automatic variable names will be "x1", "x2", and so forth. If
means is named, such as c("myx1" = 7, "myx2" = 13, "myx3" =
44), those names will be come column names in the output
matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sds</code></td>
<td>
<p>Standard deviations for the variables.  If less than p
values are supplied, they will be recycled.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rho</code></td>
<td>
<p>Correlation coefficient for p variables. Several input
formats are allowed (see <code>lazyCor</code>). This can be a single
number (common correlation among all variables), a full matrix
of correlations among all variables, or a vector that is
interpreted as the strictly lower triangle (a vech).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Sigma</code></td>
<td>
<p>P x P variance/covariance matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>intercept</code></td>
<td>
<p>Default = TRUE, do you want a first column filled
with 1?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>col.names</code></td>
<td>
<p>Names supplied here will override column names
supplied with the means parameter. If no names are supplied
with means, or here, we will name variables x1, x2, x3,
... xp, with Intercept at front of list if intercept =
TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>unit</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string for the name of the unit being
simulated. Might be referred to as a "group" or "district" or
"level 2" membership indicator.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>idx</code></td>
<td>
<p>If set TRUE, a column "idx" is added, numbering the
rows from 1:N. If the argument unit is not NULL, then idx is
set to TRUE, but that behavior can be overridded by
setting idx = FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Today I've decided to make the return object a data frame.  This
allows the possibility of including a character variable "unit"
within the result.  For multi-level models, that will help.  If
unit is not NULL, its value will be added as a column in the data
frame. If unit is not null, the rownames will be constructed by
pasting "unit" name and idx. If unit is not null, then idx will
be included as another column, unless the user explicitly sets
idx = FALSE.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with rownames to specify unit and
individual values, including an attribute "unit" with the
unit's name.
