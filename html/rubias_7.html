<h2>Get the average within-RU assignment rate for each collection</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes a matrix of scaled genotype likelihoods for a group of
individuals of known origin, and calculates the average rate at which individuals
in a particular collection are assigned to the correct reporting unit.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">avg_coll2correctRU(SL, coll, RU_starts, RU_vec)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SL</code></td>
<td>
<p>a scaled likelihood matrix; each column should sum to one, and represent
the probability of assignments to each collection (row) for a particular individual</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>coll</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of the collection of origin indices of the individuals (length = <code>ncol(SL)</code>)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>RU_starts</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector delineating starting indices of different reporting units in RU_vec</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>RU_vec</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of collection indices, organized by reporting unit</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The average rate of correct within-reporting unit assignment is proportional to
reporting-unit-level bias in the posterior probability for this collection;
if the correct assignment rate is high relative to other collections,
it will be upwardly biased, and vice versa. The inverse of this vector is used
to scale Dirichlet draws of <code>omega</code> during misassignment-scaled MCMC.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>avg_coll2correctRU</code> returns a vector of length <code>nrow(SL)</code>, where
each element represents the average proportion of fish from the corresponding collection
which are correctly assigned to the proper collection, or misassigned to another
collection within the same reporting unit. This is distinct from the rate of
correct assignment at the collection level, which is too low and variable to serve
as a stable metric for <code>omega</code> scaling.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">locnames &lt;- names(alewife)[-(1:16)][c(TRUE, FALSE)]
ploidies &lt;- rep(2, length(locnames))
names(ploidies) &lt;- locnames

params &lt;- tcf2param_list(alewife, 17, ploidies = ploidies)
SL &lt;- geno_logL(params) %&gt;% exp() %&gt;% apply(2, function(x) x/sum(x))
correct &lt;- avg_coll2correctRU(SL, params$coll, params$RU_starts, params$RU_vec)
</code></pre>
