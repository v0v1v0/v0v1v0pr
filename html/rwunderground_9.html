<h2>Return POSIXct time from 7 variables.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In locations with a Daylight Saving/Standard
time change that occurs twice annually, the year has one 23 hour day 
and one 25 hour day, if by day we mean "an ordered set of all instants
in time which are assigned the same date".  In the US/Los_Angeles 
timezone, there is one day in the spring where are no valid times 
between the moment before 02:00:00 and 03:00:00.  Similarly, there
is one day in the fall where there are two instants described by all
times between 01:00:00 and 01:59:59, first as a set of PDT times, then
as a set of PST times. <code>as.POSIXct()</code> doesn't handle this case well.
Times inside this region are assigned to DST until the sequence of
clock times has a time which is the same or earlier than its predecessor,
and all subsequent ambiguous times are assigned to Standard Time.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dst_POSIXct(y, m, d, hr, mn, sec, tz)
</code></pre>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>POSIXct time assuming vectors sorted by true chronological order,
at least for the hour that "occurs twice", once with Daylight Time, 
then again with Standard Time.  If there are no nonmonotonicities in 
the times, all times in this hour will be assumed to be Daylight Time.
