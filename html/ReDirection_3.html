<h2>reaction_vector()</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function of the package 'ReDirection', combinatorially sums non-zero
and unique reaction vectors of the null space and the generated subspace(s).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">reaction_vector(xsol)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xsol</code></td>
<td>
<p>The null space spanning vectors of the checked and modified user-
defined stoichiometry matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The resultant reaction vectors (RVs) comprise every unique reaction as a
sequence of identical components across  all RVs and are processed further.
</p>
<p>The RVs are evaluated for the presence of duplicated vectors and the same are
removed.
</p>
<p>If and only if the combined propensity of every reaction fulfills the output
criteria (non-zero, greater than unity) are the iterations stopped, otherwise
another commences.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>mtdf Vectors are the resultant reaction vectors which are computed by
by combinatorially summing the non-zero and null space spanning vectors and
the subspace(s) generated.
