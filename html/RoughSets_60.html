<h2>Data set of the package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Several datasets have been embedded in this package to be used as decision table of examples.
They can be accessed by typing <code>data(RoughSetData)</code>. The following is a description of each 
datasets.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><b>The hiring dataset</b>
</p>
<p>It is simple data taken from (Komorowski et al, 1999) where all the attributes have nominal values. 
It consists of eight objects with four conditional attributes and one decision attribute. 
The detailed description of each attribute is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Diploma: it has the following values: {"MBA", "MSc", "MCE"}.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Exprience: it has the following values: {"High", "Low", "Medium"}.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> French: it has the following values: {"Yes", "No"}.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Reference: it has the following values: {"Excellent", "Good", "Neutral"}.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Decision: it is a decision attribute that contains the following values: {"Accept", "Reject"}.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The housing dataset</b>
</p>
<p>This data was taken from the Boston housing dataset located at the UCI Machine Learning repository, 
available at http://www.ics.uci.edu. It was first created by 
(Harrison and Rubinfeld, 1978). It contains 506 objects with 13 conditional attributes and one decision attribute.
Furthermore, it should be noted that the housing dataset is a regression dataset which means that 
the decision attribute has continuous values. The conditional attributes contain both continuous and nominal attributes.
The following is a description of each attribute:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> CRIM: it is a continuous attribute that expresses per capita crime rate by town. 
It has values in: [0.0062, 88.9762].
</p>
</li>

zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft. It has values in: [0, 100].
</p>
</li>
<li>

It has values in: [0.46, 27.74].
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> CHAS: it is a nominal attribute that represents Charles River dummy variable. 
It has two values which are 1 if tract bounds river and 0 otherwise.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> NOX: it is a continuous attribute that shows the nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
It has values in: [0.385, 0.871].
</p>
</li>

It has values in: [3.561, 8.78].
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> AGE: it is a continuous attribute that expresses proportion of owner-occupied 
units built prior to 1940. It has values in: [2.9, 100].
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> DIS: it is a continuous attribute that shows weighted distances to five Boston employment centres.
It has values in: [1.1296, 12.1265].
</p>
</li>

it has the integer value from 1 to 24.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> TAX: it is a continuous attribute that shows the full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
It has values in: [187, 711].
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> PTRATIO: it is a continuous attribute that shows the pupil-teacher ratio by town.
It has values in: [12.6, 22].
</p>
</li>
<li>

where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town. It has values in: [0.32, 396.9].
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> LSTAT: it is a continuous attribute that illustrates the percentage of lower status of the population.

</p>
</li>
<li>

It has values in: [5, 50].
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The wine dataset</b>
</p>
<p>This dataset is a classification dataset introduced first by (Forina, et al) 
which is commonly used as benchmark for simulation in the machine learning area. 
Additionally, it is available at the KEEL dataset repository (Alcala-Fdez, 2009), available at http://www.keel.es/. 
It consists of 178 instances with 13 conditional attributes and one decision attribute 
where all conditional attributes have continuous values. The description of
