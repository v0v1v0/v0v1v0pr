<h2>Loads Axon Binary Files</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Loads Axon Binary Files (both 'ABF' and 'ABF2') created by Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices software such as 'pClamp'.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Reads ABF2 files, created by pClamp 10 and newer, and ABF files, created by pClamp 9 and older. Currently, code is tested under Linux only. For this purpose, multiple data sets are used which cannot be included in the package. We would very much appreciate to receive further data sets for testing purposes. A repository to upload data sets can be provided at request.
