<h2>Apply patterns to formulas</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The family of <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠apply_*_pattern()⁠</code> functions that are used to expand <code>fmls</code>
by specified patterns. These functions are not intended to be used directly
but as internal functions. They have been exposed to allow for potential
user-defined use cases.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">apply_pattern(x, pattern)

apply_fundamental_pattern(x)

apply_direct_pattern(x)

apply_sequential_pattern(x)

apply_parallel_pattern(x)

apply_rolling_interaction_pattern(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>tm</code> object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pattern</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string that specifies the pattern to use</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Currently supported patterns are: fundamental, direct, sequential, parallel.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a <code>tbl_df</code> object that has special column names and rows.
Each row is essentially a precursor to a new formula.
</p>
<p>These columns and rows must be present to be used with the <code>fmls()</code>
function, and generally are the expected result of the specified pattern.
They will undergo further internal modification prior to being turned into
a <code>fmls</code> object, but this is an developer consideration. If developing a
pattern, please use this guide to ensure that the output is compatible with
the <code>fmls()</code> function.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> outcome: a single term that is the expected outcome variable
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> exposure: a single term that is the expected exposure variable, which may not be present in every row
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> covariate_*: the covariates expand based on the number that are present (e.g. "covariate_1", "covariate_2", etc)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
