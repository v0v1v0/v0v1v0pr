<h2>Get or set RAPID7_OPENDATA_API_KEY value</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The API wrapper functions in this package all rely on a Rapid7 Open Data PI key residing in
the environment variable <code>RAPID7_OPENDATA_API_KEY</code>. The easiest way to accomplish this
is to set it in the '.Renviron' file in your home directory.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rapid7_api_key(force = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>force</code></td>
<td>
<p>Force setting a new Rapid7 Open Data API key for the current environment?</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>API requests are authenticated by a key which can be found and managed from your user
profile. With every call to the API, the user must be authenticated. The API has a
simple means to do this by passing in your key as an HTTP “Authorization” header with
the request.
</p>
<p>When you signed up for Rapid7 Open Data, a ‘default-key’ was generated for your convenience.
This is the key that is used throughout the example code within algorithm pages. For
these examples to work correctly, this default key must exist with all the permissions,
otherwise the usage examples may result in a 401 Unauthorized error.
</p>
<p>You need a Rapid7 account to get an API key. You can request a free account via
&lt;https://opendata.rapid7.com/#register&gt; and then navigate to the "Open Data API"
link there to create both an organizational key and a user key. You can only
use **user keys** with the Open Data API and you will receive error messages
indicating so if you try to use an organizational key.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>atomic character vector containing the Rapid7 Open Data API key
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>As the API documentation says, you need a **User** key vs an **Org** key.
