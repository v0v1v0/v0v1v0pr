<h2>Mark-Recapture Sample Size, Robson-Regier</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates minimum sample size for one sampling event in a
Petersen mark-recapture experiment, given the sample size in the other
event and an best guess at true abundance.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">n2RR(
  N,
  n1,
  conf = c(0.99, 0.95, 0.9, 0.85, 0.8, 0.75),
  acc = c(0.5, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01)
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>N</code></td>
<td>
<p>The best guess at true abundance</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n1</code></td>
<td>
<p>The size of the first (or second) sampling event</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>conf</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of the desired levels of confidence to investigate.
Allowed values are any of <code>c(0.99,0.95,0.9,0.85,0.8,0.75)</code>.  Defaults to
all of <code>c(0.99,0.95,0.85,0.8,0.75)</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>acc</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of the desired levels of relative accuracy to
investigate.  Allowed values are any of
<code>c(0.5,0.25,0.2,0.15,0.1,0.05,0.01)</code>.  Defaults to all of
<code>c(0.5,0.25,0.2,0.15,0.1,0.05,0.01)</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of minimum sample sizes.  Each list element corresponds to a
unique level of confidence, and is defined as a data frame with each row
corresponding to a unique value of relative accuracy.  Two minimum sample
sizes are given: one calculated from the sample size provided for the other
event, and the other calculated under n1=n2, the most efficient scenario.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Any Petersen-type estimator (such as this) depends on a set of
assumptions: </p>
 <ul>
<li>
<p>  The population is closed; that is, that there
are no births, deaths, immigration, or emigration between sampling events
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> All individuals have the same probability of capture in one of the
two events, or complete mixing occurs between events </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Marking in the
first event does not affect probability of recapture in the second event
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Individuals do not lose marks between events </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> All marks will be
reported in the second event </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible that the sample size - accuracy relationship will be better illustrated using plotn2sim.
