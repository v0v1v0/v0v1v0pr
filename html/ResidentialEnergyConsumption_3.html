<h2>Solarcadaster features for individual households.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data contains information about floor and roof spaces, as well as the energy demand for 
each individual household. For each household in *elcons_15min*, at least five nearest 
neighbors are available in this dataset. When there are more than five nearest neighbors, 
there are at least two core addresses from which the distances were calculated (e.g., 
2 adresses means 10 nearest neighbors).
