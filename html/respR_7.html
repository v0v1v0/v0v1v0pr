<h2>Automatically determine most linear, highest, lowest and rolling oxygen
uptake or production rates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>auto_rate</code> performs rolling regressions on a dataset to determine the <em>most
linear, highest, lowest, maximum, minimum, rolling</em>, and <em>interval</em> rates of
change in oxygen against time. A rolling regression of the specified <code>width</code>
is performed on the entire dataset, then based on the "<code>method</code>" input, the
resulting regressions are ranked or ordered, and the output summarised.

<h4>Ranking and ordering algorithms</h4>

<p>Currently, <code>auto_rate</code> contains seven ranking and ordering algorithms that
can be applied using the <code>method</code> input:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>linear</code>: Uses kernel density estimation (KDE) to learn the shape of the
entire dataset and <em>automatically identify</em> the most linear regions of the
timeseries. This is achieved by using the smoothing bandwidth of the KDE to
re-sample the "peaks" in the KDE to determine linear regions of the data. The
summary output will contain only the regressions identified as coming from
linear regions of the data, ranked by order of the KDE density analysis. This
is present in the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$summary⁠</code> component of the output as <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$density⁠</code>. Under
this method, the <code>width</code> input is used as a starting seed value, but the
resulting regressions may be of any width. See
<a href="https://januarharianto.github.io/respR/articles/auto_rate">here</a> for full
details.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>highest</code>: Every regression of the specified <code>width</code> across the entire
timeseries is calculated, then ordered using <em><strong>absolute</strong></em> rate values from
highest to lowest. Essentially, this option ignores the sign of the rate, and
can only be used when rates all have the same sign. Rates will be ordered
from highest to lowest in the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$summary⁠</code> table regardless of if they are
oxygen uptake or oxygen production rates.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>lowest</code>: Every regression of the specified <code>width</code> across the entire
timeseries is calculated, then ordered using <em><strong>absolute</strong></em> rate values from
lowest to highest. Essentially, this option ignores the sign of the rate, and
can only be used when rates all have the same sign. Rates will be ordered
from lowest to highest in the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$summary⁠</code> table regardless of if they are
oxygen uptake or oxygen production rates.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>maximum</code>: Every regression of the specified <code>width</code> across the entire
timeseries is calculated, then ordered using <em><strong>numerical</strong></em> rate values from
maximum to minimum. Takes <em><strong>full account of the sign of the rate</strong></em>.
Therefore, oxygen uptake rates, which in <code>respR</code> are negative, would be
ordered from lowest (least negative), to highest (most negative) in the
summary table in numerical order. Therefore, generally this method should
only be used when rates are a mix of oxygen consumption and production rates,
such as when positive rates may result from regressions fit over flush
periods in intermittent-flow respirometry. Generally, for most analyses where
maximum or minimum rates are of interest the <code>"highest"</code> or <code>"lowest"</code>
methods should be used.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>minimum</code>: Every regression of the specified <code>width</code> across the entire
timeseries is calculated, then ordered using <em><strong>numerical</strong></em> rate values from
minimum to maximum. Takes <em><strong>full account of the sign of the rate</strong></em>.
Therefore, oxygen uptake rates, which in <code>respR</code> are negative, would be
ordered from highest (most negative) to lowest (least negative) in the
summary table in numerical order. Therefore, generally this method should
only be used when rates are a mix of oxygen consumption and production rates,
such as when positive rates may result from regressions fit over flush
periods in intermittent-flow respirometry. Generally, for most analyses where
maximum or minimum rates are of interest the <code>"highest"</code> or <code>"lowest"</code>
methods should be used.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>rolling</code>: A rolling regression of the specified <code>width</code> is performed
across the entire timeseries. No reordering of results is performed.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>interval</code>: multiple, successive, non-overlapping regressions of the
specified <code>width</code> are extracted from the rolling regressions, ordered by
time.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Further selection and filtering of results</h4>

<p>For further selection or subsetting of <code>auto_rate</code> results, see the dedicated
<code>select_rate()</code> function, which allows subsetting of rates by various
criteria, including r-squared, data region, percentiles, and more.
</p>



<h4>Units</h4>

<p>There are no units involved in <code>auto_rate</code>. This is a deliberate decision.
The units of oxygen concentration and time will be specified later in
<code>convert_rate()</code> when rates are converted to specific output units.
</p>



<h4>The <code>width</code> and <code>by</code> inputs</h4>

<p>If <code>by = "time"</code>, the <code>width</code> input represents a time window in the units of
the time data in <code>x</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>by = "row"</code> and <code>width</code> is between 0 and 1 it represents a proportion of
the total data length, as in the equation <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠floor(width * number of data rows)⁠</code>. For example, 0.2 represents a rolling window of 20% of the data
width. Otherwise, if entered as an integer of 2 or greater, the <code>width</code>
represents the number of rows.
</p>
<p>For both <code>by</code> inputs, if left as <code>width = NULL</code> it defaults to 0.2 or a
window of 20% of the data length.
</p>
<p>In most cases, <code>by</code> should be left as the default <code>"row"</code>, and the <code>width</code>
chosen with this in mind, as it is considerably more computationally
efficient. Changing to <code>"time"</code> causes the function to perform checks for
irregular time intervals at every iteration of the rolling regression, which
adds to computation time. This is to ensure the specified <code>width</code> input is
honoured in the time units and rates correctly calculated, even if the data
is unevenly spaced or has gaps.
</p>



<h4>Plot</h4>

<p>A plot is produced (provided <code>plot = TRUE</code>) showing the original data
timeseries of oxygen against time (bottom blue axis) and row index (top red
axis), with the rate result region highlighted. Second panel is a close-up of
the rate region with linear model coefficients. Third panel is a rolling rate
plot (note the reversed y-axis so that higher oxygen uptake rates are plotted
higher), of a rolling rate of the input <code>width</code> across the whole dataset.
Each rate is plotted against the middle of the time and row range used to
calculate it. The dashed line indicates the value of the current rate result
plotted in panels 1 and 2. The fourth and fifth panels are summary plots of
fit and residuals, and for the <code>linear</code> method the sisth panel the results of
the kernel density analysis, with the dashed line again indicating the value
of the current rate result plotted in panels 1 and 2.
</p>



<h4>Additional plotting options</h4>

<p>If multiple rates have been calculated, by default the first (<code>pos = 1</code>) is
plotted. Others can be plotted by changing the <code>pos</code> input either in the main
function call, or by plotting the output, e.g. <code>plot(object, pos = 2)</code>. In
addition, each sub-panel can be examined individually by using the <code>panel</code>
input, e.g. <code>plot(object, panel = 2)</code>.
</p>
<p>Console output messages can be suppressed using <code>quiet = TRUE</code>. If axis
labels or other text boxes obscure parts of the plot they can be suppressed
using <code>legend = FALSE</code>. The rate in the rolling rate plot can be plotted
<em>not</em> reversed by passing <code>rate.rev = FALSE</code>, for instance when examining
oxygen production rates so that higher production rates appear higher. If
axis labels (particularly y-axis) are difficult to read, <code>las = 2</code> can be
passed to make axis labels horizontal, and <code>oma</code> (outer margins, default <code>oma = c(0.4, 1, 1.5, 0.4)</code>), and <code>mai</code> (inner margins, default <code>mai = c(0.3, 0.15, 0.35, 0.15)</code>) used to adjust plot margins.
</p>



<h4>S3 Generic Functions</h4>

<p>Saved output objects can be used in the generic S3 functions <code>print()</code>,
<code>summary()</code>, and <code>mean()</code>.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>print()</code>: prints a single result, by default the first rate. Others can be
printed by passing the <code>pos</code> input. e.g. <code>print(x, pos = 2)</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>summary()</code>: prints summary table of all results and metadata, or those
specified by the <code>pos</code> input. e.g. <code>summary(x, pos = 1:5)</code>. The summary can
be exported as a separate data frame by passing <code>export = TRUE</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>mean()</code>: calculates the mean of all rates, or those specified by the <code>pos</code>
input. e.g. <code>mean(x, pos = 1:5)</code> The mean can be exported as a separate value
by passing <code>export = TRUE</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
