<h2>Consistency Tests for the Abundance Estimator, Complete Stratification</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Conducts two chi-squared tests for the consistency of the
Petersen-type abundance estimator.  These tests provide explore evidence
against equal capture probabilities in either the first or second sampling
event.  Also conducts a third chi-squared test of unequal capture
probabilities between sampling events for each stratum, in the case of
small sample sizes (fewer than 100 in either sampling event and fewer than
30 recaptures), which may be used to suggest unequal capture probabilities
in either the first or second event.
</p>
<p>Typically, if either of the first two test p-values is greater than the
significance level, use of a Petersen-type estimator is considered
justified.
</p>
<p>If tests give evidence of unequal capture probabilities between strata, a
stratified estimator should be used, such as Nstrat.
</p>
<p>This function assumes stratification in both sampling events, such that
individuals cannot move from one strata to another (such as by size or
gender).  If movement between strata may occur (such as in the case of
stratification by time or area), use of consistencytest is
recommended.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Any Petersen-type estimator (such as this) depends on a set of
assumptions: </p>
 <ul>
<li>
<p>  The population is closed; that is, that there
are no births, deaths, immigration, or emigration between sampling events
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> All individuals have the same probability of capture in one of the
two events, or complete mixing occurs between events </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Marking in the
first event does not affect probability of recapture in the second event
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Individuals do not lose marks between events </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> All marks will be
reported in the second event </p>
</li>
</ul>
