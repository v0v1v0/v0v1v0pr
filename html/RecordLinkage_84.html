<h2>
Create a minimal training set
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Samples a subset of the provided data (comparison patterns) so that every
comparison pattern in <code>rpairs</code> is represented in the subset
at least once.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">getMinimalTrain(rpairs, nEx = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rpairs</code></td>
<td>

<p>A <code>"RecLinkData"</code> or <code>"RLBigData"</code> object. The data set
from which to create a minimal training set.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nEx</code></td>
<td>

<p>The desired number of examples per comparison pattern.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Our internal research has given indication that in the context of Record Linkage 
with supervised classification procedures small training sets are often 
sufficient, provided they cover the whole range of present comparison patterns.
</p>
<p>By default, this function creates a minimal training set that is
a subset of the record pairs to be classified in which every present 
comparison pattern is represented by exactly one training example.
By this approach, the work to classify a training set by
clerical review can be minimized while keeping a good classification 
performance.
</p>
<p>Larger training sets can be obtained by setting <code>nEx</code> to a 
higher number. Up to <code>nEx</code> examples for every comparison pattern
are randomly selected, limited by the total number of record pairs with
that pattern.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of the same class as <code>rpairs</code>, representing a minimal
comprehensive training set. The appropriate subset of comparison patterns
(and weights, if present) is taken, all other components are copied.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Application is only advisable for binary comparison patterns (i.e. only 0
and 1 appear as agreement values). For patterns with string comparison
values, the size of the returned set can be too large for a manual review.
A warning is issued if fuzzy agreement values (<code class="reqn">&gt;0</code> and <code class="reqn">&lt;1</code>) are
present in the data.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Due to the small size of the resulting training set, outliers can have a
relatively high impact on further classification results. Stable methods
such as Bagging or Support-Vector-Machines should be used in conjunction
with minimal training sets to minimize this risk.
