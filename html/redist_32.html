<h2>Calculate compactness measures for a set of plans</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>redist.compactness</code> is used to compute different compactness statistics for a
shapefile. It currently computes the Polsby-Popper, Schwartzberg score, Length-Width Ratio,
Convex Hull score, Reock score, Boyce Clark Index, Fryer Holden score, Edges Removed number,
and the log of the Spanning Trees.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">distr_compactness(map, measure = "FracKept", .data = cur_plans(), ...)

redist.compactness(
  shp = NULL,
  plans,
  measure = c("PolsbyPopper"),
  total_pop = NULL,
  adj = NULL,
  draw = 1,
  ncores = 1,
  counties = NULL,
  planarize = 3857,
  ppRcpp,
  perim_path,
  perim_df
)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function computes specified compactness scores for a map.  If
there is more than one shape specified for a single district, it combines
them, if necessary, and computes one score for each district.
</p>
<p>Polsby-Popper is computed as </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\frac{4*\pi*A(d)}{P(d)^2}</code>
</p>
<p> where A is the area
function, the district is d, and P is the perimeter function. All  values are between
0 and 1, where larger values are more compact.
</p>
<p>Schwartzberg is computed as </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\frac{P(d)}{2*\pi*\sqrt{\frac{A(d)}{\pi}}}</code>
</p>

<p>where A is the area function, the district is d, and P is the perimeter function.
All  values are between 0 and 1, where larger values are more compact.
</p>
<p>The Length Width ratio is computed as </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\frac{length}{width}</code>
</p>
<p> where length
is the shorter of the maximum x distance and the maximum y distance. Width is
the longer of the two values. All  values are between 0 and 1, where larger
values are more compact.
</p>
<p>The Convex Hull score is computed as </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\frac{A(d)}{A(CVH)}</code>
</p>
<p> where A is the area
function, d is the district, and CVH is the convex hull of the district. All
values are between 0 and 1, where larger values are more compact.
</p>
<p>The Reock score is computed as </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\frac{A(d)}{A(MBC)}</code>
</p>
<p> where A is the area
function, d is the district, and MBC is the minimum bounding circle of the
district. All values are between 0 and 1, where larger values are more compact.
</p>
<p>The Boyce Clark Index is computed as </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">1 - \sum_{1}^{16}\{\frac{|\frac{r_i}{\sum_ir_i}*100-6.25 |\}}{200}</code>
</p>
<p>.
The <code class="reqn">r_i</code> are the distances of the 16 radii computed from the geometric
centroid of the shape to the most outward point of the shape that intersects
the radii, if the centroid is contained within the shape.  If the centroid
lies outside of the shape, a point on the surface is used, which will naturally
incur a penalty to the score. All  values are between 0 and 1,
where larger values are more compact.
</p>
<p>The Fryer Holden score for each district is computed with </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">Pop\odot D(precinct)^2</code>
</p>
<p>,
where <code class="reqn">Pop</code> is the population product matrix.  Each element is the
product of the i-th and j-th precinct's populations.  D represents the distance,
where the matrix is the distance between each precinct.  To fully compute this
index, for any map, the sum of these values should be used as the numerator.
The denominator can be calculated from the full enumeration of districts as the
smallest calculated numerator. This produces very large numbers, where smaller
values are more compact.
</p>
<p>The log spanning tree measure is the logarithm of the product of the
number of spanning trees which can be drawn on each district.
</p>
<p>The edges removed measure is number of edges removed from the underlying adjacency graph.
A smaller number of edges removed is more compact.
</p>
<p>The fraction kept measure is the fraction of edges that were not removed from the
underlying adjacency graph. This takes values 0 - 1, where 1 is more compact.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A tibble with a column that specifies the district, a column for
each specified measure, and a column that specifies the map number.
