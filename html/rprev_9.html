<h2>Simulated patient dataset.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset in the format of a disease registry, where the outcome being modelled is death
due to the simulated disease. The registry began in January 2003, with 1000 incident cases being
recorded over a period of nearly exactly ten years. The patients are followed up for a further
two years until 17.03.2015, at which point any subjects alive are marked as right censored.
