<h2>
Estimating the main parameters of a chromatographic peak.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function processPeak uses peak data to calculate the main parameters of the
peak: retention time, maximum high, A60, B60, A10, B10 and area.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">processPeak(peak, baseline=FALSE, method, flow=FALSE, compound=FALSE,
area=FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>peak</code></td>
<td>

<p>data frame. The input is a peak selected by the readChrom function.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>baseline</code></td>
<td>

<p>if TRUE, the function estimates a baseline using asymmetric least squares and
subtracts it from the data. By default, FALSE.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>flow</code></td>
<td>

<p>numeric. This value will be written in the output data frame.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>

<p>string indicating the method used to process the peak.
"pvmg": the upper part of the peak is filtered and fitted by the PVMG model by
non-linear fitting obtaining the time and height at the peak maximum. Then
cubic splines is applied obtaining the half-widths measured at 60.65% and
10% peak height.
"splines": interpolation by cubic splines to obtain both half-widths left and
right either at 60.65% and 10% peak height from the signal of the peak.
"direct": Interpolation of the signal of the peak to estimate the half-widths.
</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>compound</code></td>
<td>

<p>string. The name of the compound will be written in the output data frame.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>area</code></td>
<td>

<p>if TRUE, the peak area is estimated using by trapezoidal numerical integration
(pracma package). By default, FALSE.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The PVMG model peak (Parabolic Variance Modified Gaussian) is a simplification
of the PLMG model (Parabolic Lorentzian Modified Gaussian) removing the
Lorentzian function in the PLMG model and using a Gaussian model with a variance
showing only a parabolic change with time. This simplified model gives good
performance in relatively narrow ranges along the peak elution. It fits
accurately the upper region of the peak. The estimation of the time and height
at the peak maximum is carried out by non-linear fittings of the chromatographic
data to the PVMG equation.
</p>
<p>The difference between "pvmg" and "splines" is that the height and time at the
peak maximum are calculated either by the PVGM model or by interpolation using
the natural signal without being modelled. Then interpolation by cubic splines
is applied for obtaining the half-widths at 60.65% and 10% of peak height. The
method "direct" obtain the half-widths directly from the natural signal by
interpolation.
</p>
<p>If an error "singular gradient matrix at initial parameter estimates" occurs,
the retention times used to subset the peak by the readChrom function need to be
fitted again. See examples.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function returns a data frame with the following items: compound (if
supplied), flow(if supplied), retention time (tr), maximum high (Hmax), A60,
B60, A10, B10, area, RSE (square root of the estimated variance of the random
error, MeanError (prediction error) and correlation (R).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>To get compounds and flows in the output data frame, they need to be witten by
the user when using this function.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> ## Reading the file to get the peak
 # peak &lt;- readChrom("file.csv", do.plot = T,
 #   t1=28, t2=29.5)
 # parameters &lt;- processPeak(peak, baseline=FALSE, flow=0.1,
 #   method="pvmg", compound="alanine", area=TRUE)

 ## If when using processPeak it gives an error "singular gradient matrix
 ## at initial parameter estimates", the peak needs to be read again to fit
 ## retention times. For example:

 # peak &lt;- readChrom("file.csv", do.plot = T,
 #    t1=28.5, t2=31)

  parameters &lt;- processPeak(peak, baseline = FALSE, flow = 0.1, method = "pvmg",
