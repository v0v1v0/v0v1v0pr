Quantitative Evaluation of the Native Fertility of Tropical Soils
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides implments the QUEFTS model.
</p>
<p>QUEFTS (Quantitative Evaluation of the Native Fertility of Tropical Soils) model (1) estimates native nutrient (N, P, K) supply of soils from a few soil chemical properties; and (2) computes crop yield given that supply, fertilizer application and crop parameters.  See Janssen et al. (1990) &lt;doi:10.1016/0016-7061(90)90021-Z&gt; for the technical details and Sattari et al. (2014) &lt;doi:10.1016/j.fcr.2013.12.005&gt; for a recent evaluation and improvements. 
</p>
<p>The package is particularly useful if you want to make spatial predictions with QUEFTS.
</p>
<p>There are also a few functions that can help with computing the amount of nutriets supplied with fertilizer (blends) and compute the optimal use of fertilizer given a goal in nutrients, available products, and their prices.
