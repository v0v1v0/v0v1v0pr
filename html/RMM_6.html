<h3>Details</h3>

<p>'Hotel 1' data contains information on the available alternatives, i.e.,
choice sets and the associated prices at the time of each customer’s booking decision.
We preprocessed 'Hotel 1' data and provide it in two types of
data format, '<code>Hotel_Long</code>' and '<code>Hotel_Wide</code>'.
</p>
<p>The following are the preprocessing of 'Hotel 1' data.
</p>
<p>1. Customers' booking transactions that had only one room type available
in their choice set were removed as our methods require at least
two different products in each choice set.
</p>
<p>2. Duplicate records was removed.
</p>
<p>3. Choice sets with less than 30 observations, representing rare case were removed.
</p>
