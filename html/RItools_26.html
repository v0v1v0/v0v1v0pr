<h2>Nuclear Power Station Construction Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data relate to the construction of 32 light water reactor (LWR)
plants constructed in the U.S.A in the late 1960's and early
1970's.  The data was collected with the aim of predicting the cost
of construction of further LWR plants.  6 of the power plants had
partial turnkey guarantees and it is possible that, for these
plants, some manufacturers' subsidies may be hidden in the quoted
capital costs.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">nuclearplants
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 32 rows and 11 columns
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> cost: The capital cost of construction in millions of
dollars adjusted to 1976 base.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> date: The date on which the construction permit was issued.
The data are measured in years since January 1 1990 to the
nearest month.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> t1: The time between application for and issue of the
construction permit.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> t2: The time between issue of operating license and
construction permit.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> cap: The net capacity of the power plant (MWe).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> pr: A binary variable where <code>1</code> indicates the prior
existence of a LWR plant at the same site.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ne: A binary variable where <code>1</code> indicates that the
plant was constructed in the north-east region of the U.S.A.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ct: A binary variable where <code>1</code> indicates the use of a
cooling tower in the plant.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> bw: A binary variable where <code>1</code> indicates that the
nuclear steam supply system was manufactured by Babcock-Wilcox.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> cum.n: The cumulative number of power plants constructed by
each architect-engineer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> pt: A binary variable where <code>1</code> indicates those plants
with partial turnkey guarantees.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The data were obtained from the <code>boot</code> package, for
which they were in turn taken from Cox and Snell (1981). Although
the data themselves are the same as those in the <code>nuclear</code>
data frame in the <code>boot</code> package, the row names of the data
frame have been changed.  (The new row names were selected to
ease certain demonstrations in <code>optmatch</code>.)
</p>
<p>This documentation page is also adapted from the <code>boot</code>
package, written by Angelo Canty and ported to R by Brian Ripley.
