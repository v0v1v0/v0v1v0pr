<h2>Provide RcppGSL Compiler and Linker Flags</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>LdFlags</code> and <code>CFlags</code> return the required flags and
options for the compiler and system linker in order to build against
GNU GSL. This allows portable use of <span class="pkg">RcppGSL</span> (which needs the
GNU GSL) as package location as well as operating-system specific
details are abstracted away behind the interface of this function.
</p>
<p><code>LdFlags</code> and <code>CFlags</code> are commonly called from the files
<code>Makevars</code> (or <code>Makevars.win</code>) rather than in an interactive
session. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">LdFlags(print=TRUE)
CFlags(print=TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>print</code></td>
<td>
<p>A boolean determining whether the requested value is
returned on the standard output, or silenly as a value.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Thee functions are not meant to used interactively, and are intended
solely for use by the build tools.
</p>
<p>The values that are returned are acquired by the package at load
time. On Linux and OS X, the <code>pkg-config</code> program is queried. On
Windows, environment variables used for GNU GSL builds with R are used.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A character vector suitable by use by the system compiler linker in order to
compile and/or link against the GNU GSK.
</p>
