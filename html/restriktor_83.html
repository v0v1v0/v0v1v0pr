<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the <strong>added-evidence</strong> approach, evidence from each study or dataset is 
cumulatively aggregated. This means that for every new study, the log-likelihood 
and the penalty term are added to the cumulative totals. The strength of the 
aggregated evidence in this approach depends on the nature of the evidence itself. 
Simply having more studies doesn't necessarily mean stronger evidence if those 
studies provide weak or contradictory evidence.<br> 
Opt for this approach when you anticipate each new piece of evidence to provide an 
incremental contribution to the overall evidence, without the need to normalize or 
average across datasets. It's especially suitable when you believe that the 
aggregated evidence from multiple studies is stronger than if the data were combined 
into a single study.
</p>
<p>The <strong>equal-evidence</strong> approach aggregates the cumulative evidence in the same 
manner as the added-evidence approach. However, when calculating the GORICA, the 
cumulative evidence is divided by the number of studies. This ensures that the 
contribution from each study or dataset remains equal, regardless of the total count. 
Conceptually, aggregating evidence from multiple studies in this approach can be 
likened to obtaining evidence from a single larger study, similar to how a 
meta-analysis treats combined evidence.<br>
Choose this method when you want each study to contribute equally to the overall 
evidence, irrespective of the size or scope of each individual dataset. It's ideal 
for situations where you view the combined evidence from multiple studies as 
equivalent to that from a single, larger study.
</p>
<p>The <strong>average-evidence</strong> method can be conceptualized as a form of multiverse 
analysis. When faced with a single dataset, there are often numerous analytical 
choices available, such as handling missing data, selecting variables, or choosing 
statistical methods. Each choice can lead to a different analysis or model, creating 
a "multiverse" of possible outcomes.<br>
For each of these analyses, an "evidence" score can be calculated, indicating how 
well the model fits the data. Some models might offer a superior fit, while others 
might not align as closely with the data. The average-evidence method aggregates 
these scores, providing an average measure of fit across all considered models.
This approach offers an overarching perspective on the general trend across all 
analyses. If the average evidence suggests a good fit, it indicates that the 
majority of the chosen analyses align well with the data. This method is invaluable 
for assessing the robustness of results, ensuring that findings are not merely 
artifacts of a specific analytical choice but are consistent across various model 
specifications on the same dataset.<br>
Opt for the average-evidence approach when you wish to gauge the central tendency 
of evidence across multiple analytical choices. It's especially beneficial when 
aiming to determine the robustness of results across various model specifications 
applied to the same dataset.
