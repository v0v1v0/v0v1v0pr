<h2>
Results from Michelson's determination of the velocity of light in air.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data are actually measurements obtained
by Michelson between June 5, 1879, and July
2, 1879. The data are in km/sec if 299000 is added
to each value. Working backwards from the current
‘true value’ of the velocity of light in vacuum
(299,792.5 km/sec) and using Michelson's own
adjustment for the effect of air, the comparable
‘true value’ for these data is 734.5 (considerably
smaller than the actual measurements). Michelson
used a modification of Foucault's 1850 experimental
method which consisted of passing light from a source
off a rapidly rotating mirror to a distant fixed
mirror, and back to the rotating mirror. Presumably
the five sets of 20 measurements are in time sequence.
