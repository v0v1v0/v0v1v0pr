<h2>Calculates recursion information from the 3D trajectory</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A sphere of radius R is drawn around each point in the trajectory. The number of
revisits is calculated as the number of segments of the trajectory passing through that sphere.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">getRecursions3D(
  x,
  radius,
  threshold = 0,
  timeunits = c("hours", "secs", "mins", "days"),
  verbose = TRUE
)

## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
getRecursions3D(
  x,
  radius,
  threshold = 0,
  timeunits = c("hours", "secs", "mins", "days"),
  verbose = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame with 
the trajectory data in five columns (the x-coordinate, the y-coordinate, the z-coordinate, the datetime, and the animal id).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>radius</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric radius to use in units of the (x,y,z) location data to detect recursions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>a time difference (in units <code>timeunits</code>) to ignore excursions outside the radius. Defaults to 0.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>timeunits</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string specifying units to calculate time differences in for the time spans inside the radius and since the 
visit in <code>revisitStats</code>. Defaults to hours.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>TRUE</code> to output complete information (can be large for large input data frames) or 
<code>FALSE</code> to output basic information.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For each point in the trajectory, a sphere of radius R is drawn around that point.
Then the number of segments of the trajectory passing through that sphere is counted. This is
the number of revisits, so each point will have at least one revisit (the initial visit). For each 
revisit, the time spent inside the sphere is calculated, as well as the time since the last 
visit (NA for the first visit). In order to calculate the time values, the crossing time of the
radius is calculated by assuming linear movement at a constant speed between the points inside
and outside the sphere.
</p>
<p><strong>Projection.</strong> Consider the projection used. Since segments are counted passing through spheres
drawn around points, an equal area projection would ensure similar size comparisons (e.g., <code>spTransform</code>). 
</p>
<p>Either single or multiple individuals are supported, but be aware that this function will be slow with
large amounts of data (e.g. millions of points), so consider pre-specifying the locations 
(<code>getRecursionsAtLocations</code>) or use clustering. Multiple individuals are handled via the <code>id</code> column of the 
data.frame.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with several components, <code>revisits</code> and <code>residenceTime</code>
are vectors of the same length as the <code>x</code> dataframe. <code>revisits</code> is the number of revisits for each 
location, where 1 means that there were 
no revisits, only the initial visit. <code>residenceTime</code> is the total time spent withing the radius. <code>radius</code>
is the specified radius used for all the calculations. <code>timeunits</code> is the specified time units used to specify
timespans.
</p>
<p>When <code>verbose = TRUE</code>, additional information 
is also returned, <code>dists</code> and <code>revisitStats</code>. Next, <code>dists</code> gives the distance matrix between
all locations. Finally, <code>revisitStats</code> gives further statistics on each visit. These are calculated 
per location (i.e., no aggregation of nearby points is performed), and give the index and location
of the point of the track at the center of the radius, the radius entrance and exit time of the track for that 
visit, how much time was spent inside the radius, and how long since the last visit (<code>NA</code> for the first visit).
