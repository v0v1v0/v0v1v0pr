<h2>Setup a fare structure to calculate the monetary costs of trips</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a basic fare structure that describes how transit fares should be
calculated in <code>travel_time_matrix()</code>, <code>expanded_travel_time_matrix()</code>,
<code>accessibility()</code> and <code>pareto_frontier()</code>. This fare structure can be
manually edited and adjusted to the existing rules in your study area, as
long as they stick to some basic premises. Please see fare structure
vignette for more information on how the fare structure works:
<code>vignette("fare_structure", package = "r5r")</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">setup_fare_structure(
  r5r_core,
  base_fare,
  by = "MODE",
  debug_path = NULL,
  debug_info = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>r5r_core</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object to connect with the R5 routing engine, created with
<code>setup_r5()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>base_fare</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric. A base value used to populate the fare
structure.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>by</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string. Describes how <code>fare_type</code>s (a classification we created
to assign fares to different routes) are distributed among routes.
Possible values are <code>MODE</code>, <code>AGENCY</code> and <code>GENERIC</code>. <code>MODE</code> is used when
the mode is what determines the price of a route (e.g. if all the buses of
a given city cost $5). <code>AGENCY</code> is used when the agency that operates each
route is what determines its price (i.e. when two different routes/modes
operated by a single agency cost the same; note that you can also use
<code>AGENCY_NAME</code>, if the agency_ids listed in your GTFS cannot be easily
interpreted). <code>GENERIC</code> is used when all the routes cost the same. Please
note that this classification can later be edited to better suit your
needs (when, for example, two types of buses cost the same, but one offers
discounts after riding the subway and the other one doesn't), but this
parameter may save you some work.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>debug_path</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either a path to a <code>.csv</code> file or <code>NULL</code>. When <code>NULL</code> (the
default), fare debugging capabilities are disabled - i.e. there's no way
to check if the fare calculation is correct. When a path is provided,
<code>r5r</code> saves different itineraries and their respective fares to the
specified file. How each itinerary is described is controlled by
<code>debug_info</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>debug_info</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either a string (when <code>debug_path</code> is a path) or <code>NULL</code>
(the default). Doesn't have any effect if <code>debug_path</code> is <code>NULL</code>. When a
string, accepts the values <code>MODE</code>, <code>ROUTE</code> and <code>MODE_ROUTE</code>. These values
dictates how itinerary information is written to the output. Let's suppose
we have an itinerary composed by two transit legs: first a subway leg
whose route_id is 001, and then a bus legs whose route_id is 007. If
<code>debug_info</code> is <code>MODE</code>, then this itinerary will be described as
<code>SUBWAY|BUS</code>. If <code>ROUTE</code>, as <code>001|007</code>. If <code>MODE_ROUTE</code>, as <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠SUBWAY 001|BUS 007⁠</code>. Please note that the final debug information will contain
not only the itineraries that were in fact used in the itineraries
returned in <code>travel_time_matrix()</code>, <code>accessibility()</code> and
<code>pareto_frontier()</code>, but all the itineraries that <code>R5</code> checked when
calculating the routes. This imposes a performance penalty when tracking
debug information (but has the positive effect of returning a larger
sample of itineraries, which might help finding some implementation issues
on the fare structure).</p>
