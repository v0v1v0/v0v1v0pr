Calculate index E and Cws
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The procedure calculates the E measure of interindividual variation, its variance and the value of the <code class="reqn">C_{ws}</code> measure of modularity after Araujo et al. (2008).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Eindex(dataset, index = "saramaki", jackknife = FALSE, precision = 1e-9)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The index E has been proposed by Araujo et al. (2008) as a measure of individual specialization where, in absence of interindividual niche variation, its value is zero. The index will increase towards one with the increase of interindividual variation.
</p>
<p>A jackknife estimation of the variance of E can be derived using the formalism of U-statistics (Aversen, 1969). For a complete description and a formal demonstration of the jackknife estimation of the variance of the E index the reader is refered to Araujo et al. (2008).
</p>
<p>A measure of the relative degree of clustering in a network to test for modularity in the niche overlap network is <code class="reqn">C_{ws}</code>. In a totally random network (i.e., a network consisting of individuals that sample randomly from the population niche), <code class="reqn">C_{ws}</code> is approximally 0, indicating no modularity. If individuals form discrete groups specialized on distinct sets of resources, <code class="reqn">C_{ws} &gt; 0</code>, and the network is modular. If <code class="reqn">C_{ws} &lt; 0</code> the network degree of clustering is actually lower than what would be expected solely on the overall network density of connections, indicating that diet variation takes place at the level of the individual, as opposed to discrete groups.
</p>
<p>The relative degree of clustering <code class="reqn">C_{ws}</code> is obtained as the mean values over all nodes the niche overlap network of the individual node weighted clustering coefficients (<code class="reqn">C_{w_i}</code>).
</p>
<p>The clustering can be measured using two different type of weighted clustering coefficients. In general the degree of unweighted clustering around a vertex <em>i</em> in a network is quantified by evaluating the number of triangles in which the vertex participates normalized by the maximum possible number of such triangles. Hence we have zero if none of the neighbours of a vertex are connected, otherwise we have one. By extending the above line of reasoning, the weighted clustering coefficient should also take into account how much weight is present in the neighbourhood of the vertex, compared to some limiting case. This can be done in several ways.
Barrat et al. (2004) were the  first to  propose a weighted version of the clustering coefficient of the form:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn"> C_{w_i} = \frac{1}{s_i(k_i -1)} \sum_{j,h}{\frac{(w_{ij}+w_{ih})}{2}a_{ij}a_{ih}a_{jh}} </code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">s_i</code> is the sum of the weights (<code class="reqn">w_i</code>) of all the edges between node i and the nodes to which it is connected; <code class="reqn">k_i</code> is the number of edges between node i and its neighbours; <code class="reqn">w_{ij}</code> is the weight of the edge between thw two nodes i and j; <code class="reqn">a</code> is 1 if an edge is present between each pair <em>ij</em>, <em>ih</em>, and <em>jh</em> respectively, and zero otherwise. The summation, therefore, quantifies the weights of all edges between node i and its neighbours that are also neighbours to each other.
</p>
<p>Samaraki et al. (2007) and Onnela et al. (2005) proposed a version of a clustering index of the form:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn"> C_{w_i} = \frac{1}{k_i(k_i -1)} \sum_{j,h}{(w_{ij}w_{ih}w_{jh})^\frac{1}{3}} </code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">k_i</code> is the number of edges between individual i and its neighbours; <code class="reqn">w_{ij}</code> is the weight of the edge between individual i and j obtained by dividing the actual weight by the maximum of all weights. The summation, therefore, quantifies the weights of all edges between individual i and its neighbours that are also neighbours to each other.
</p>
<p>The default value of the procedure has been set for analogy with the Dieta1.c code provided by Araujo et al. (2008). The original source code Dieta1.c is available from the “Ecological Archives” of the Ecological Society of America (<a href="http://esapubs.org/archive/">http://esapubs.org/archive/</a>): identifier E089-115-A1; <a href="http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E089/115/">http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E089/115/</a>.
</p>
<p>Version 1.1 of the package fixes the case of highly specialised individuals in the calculation of <code class="reqn">C_{ws}</code>.
