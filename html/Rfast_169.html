Floyd-Warshall algorithm for shortest paths in a directed graph
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Floyd-Warshall algorithm for shortest paths in a directed graph.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">floyd(x) 
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>The adjacency matrix of a directed graph. A positive number (including) in x[i, j] indicates that there is an arrow
from i to j and it also shows the cost of going from i to j. Hence, the algorithm will find not only the shortest path but also the with the smallest cost. 
A value of NA means that there is no path. Put positive number only, as negative will cause problems.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is designed to find the shortest path (if it exists) between two nodes in a graph. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix, say z, with 0 and positive numbers. The elements denote the length of the shortest path between 
each pair of points. If z[i, j] is zero it  means that there is no cost from i to j. If z[i, j] has a positive 
value it means that the length of going from i to j is equal to that value.
