<h2>Find percent of water exchanged after a flush</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate the proportion of water in a respirometer that is new after a flush. Useful for intermittent respirometry. Given 3 of the first 4 parameters, the 4th parameter is calculated.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">flush_water(vol, flow_rate, duration, perc_fresh, plot = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vol</code></td>
<td>
<p>volume of the respirometer (liter).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>flow_rate</code></td>
<td>
<p>rate of water flow into the respirometer (liters / minute).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>duration</code></td>
<td>
<p>duration of the flush (minutes).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>perc_fresh</code></td>
<td>
<p>percent of the respirometer volume that is new flushed water.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. Plot the percent exchanged as a function of flow rate and duration to see what effect would result if the rate or duration are changed. All parameters must only have a single value.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># What proportion of a 90 L respirometer is exchanged after 20 minutes of flow at 2 LPM?
flush_water(vol = 90, flow_rate = 2, duration = 20)

# Would it be worth it to extend the flush another five minutes? How much would that
# improve the exchange?
flush_water(vol = 90, flow_rate = 2, duration = 20, plot = TRUE)
# Another five minutes would increase exchange by nearly 10%.
# Perhaps that's worth the extra time...

# Visualize flushing
vol = 150
flow_rate = seq(0, 10, by = 0.5)
duration = 0:60
perc_fresh = outer(flow_rate, duration, function(flow_rate, duration){
	flush_water(vol = vol, flow_rate = flow_rate, duration = duration)
})
persp(flow_rate, duration, perc_fresh, xlab = 'Flow rate (LPM)', ylab = 'Duration (min)',
