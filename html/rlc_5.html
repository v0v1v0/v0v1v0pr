<h2>Get the currently running app</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>rlc</code> offers two ways to control an interactive app. One is by using methods of class
<code>LCApp</code>. This allows one to have any number of apps within one
R session but requires some understanding of object oriented-programming. Another way is to use
provided wrapper functions that are exported by the package. These functions internally work with
the <code>LCApp</code> object stored in the package namespace upon initialization with the
<code>openPage</code> function. <code>getPage</code> returns this object, if any.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">getPage()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note that the <code>rlc</code> package is based on the <code>jrc</code> library. Both packages are similarly organized.
Both have a central class representing the entire app and can be fully managed with their methods (<code>LCApp</code>
and <code>App</code>, respectively). And both also provide a set of wrapper functions that can be used instead of
the methods. However, wrapper functions of the <code>jrc</code> package can't be used for <code>rlc</code> apps, while <code>LCApp</code>
inherits all the methods of class <code>App</code>. Therefore, if you want to get more low-level
control over your app, such as managing client sessions, local variables and memory usage, you should use methods of the
<code>App</code> class.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>LCApp</code> or <code>NULL</code> if there is no active app.
