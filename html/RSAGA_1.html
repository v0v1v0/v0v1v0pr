<h2>RSAGA: SAGA Geoprocessing and Terrain Analysis in R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>RSAGA provides direct access to SAGA GIS functions
including, for example, a comprehensive set
of terrain analysis algorithms for calculating local
morphometric properties (slope, aspect, curvature),
hydrographic characteristics (size, height, and
aspect of catchment areas), and other process-related
terrain attributes (potential incoming solar radiation,
topographic wetness index, and more).
In addition, (R)SAGA provides functions for importing
and exporting different grid file formats, and tools
for preprocessing grids, e.g. closing gaps or filling
sinks.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>RSAGA adds a framework for creating custom-defined
focal functions, e.g. specialized filter and terrain
attributes such as the topographic wind shelter index,
within R.  This framework can be used to apply predict
methods of fitted statistical models to stacks of grids
representing predictor variables.  Furthermore,
functions are provided for conveniently picking
values at point locations from a grid using kriging
or nearest neighbour interpolation.
</p>
<p>RSAGA requires SAGA GIS (versions 2.3.1 LTS - 8.4.1)
are currently supported) and its user-contributed
modules to be available on your computer. These
can be downloaded under GPL from
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/</a>.
Please check the help page for
<code>rsaga.env()</code> to make sure that RSAGA
can find your local installation of SAGA. You may
need to 'tell' RSAGA where to find SAGA GIS.
</p>
<p>Thanks to Olaf Conrad, Andre Ringeler and all the
other SAGA GIS developers and contributors of
this excellent geocomputing tool! Thanks to Rainer
Hurling, Johan van de Wauw, Massimo Di Stefano and
others for helping to adapt SAGA to and test it on
unix and Max OSX.
