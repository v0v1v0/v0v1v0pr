<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A text file file with variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Study</dt>
<dd>
<p>This field includes the study identifier of each of the 13 primary studies which were included in the systematic review.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Type</dt>
<dd>
<p>This identifies the type of effect size used by the study authors. d  or g refer to d_IG and g_IG, P is the aggregated p values, if the repeated measures estimate was obtained it is appropriately specified, r refers to the point bi-serial correlation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>
<p>Always set to Rep. This identifies that the data was as reported by the primary study authors.</p>
</dd>
<dt>mean</dt>
<dd>
<p>The overall mean effect size reported by the study authors</p>
</dd>
<dt>pvalue</dt>
<dd>
<p>The one-sided p-value associated with the overall mean reported by the study authors. NA means the authors did not report this statistic.</p>
</dd>
<dt>UB</dt>
<dd>
<p>The upper bound of the confidence interval of the overall mean as reported by the primary study authors. NA means the authors did not report this statistic.</p>
</dd>
<dt>LB</dt>
<dd>
<p>The lower bound of the confidence interval of the overall mean as reported by the primary study authors. NA means the authors did not report this statistic.</p>
</dd>
<dt>QE</dt>
<dd>
<p>The heterogeneity statistic associated with the meta-analysis as reported by the study authors. NA means the authors did not report this statistic.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Qep</dt>
<dd>
<p>The p-value of the heterogeneity statistic associated with the meta-analysis as reported by the study authors. NA means the authors did not report this statistic.</p>
