<h2>
Transformations for simple linear regression
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes a simple linear regression model and finds the transformation of x and y that results in the highest R2 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">find_transformations(M,powers=seq(from=-3,to=3,by=.25),threshold=0.02,...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>M</code></td>
<td>

<p>A simple linear regression model fitted with <code>lm</code>
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>powers</code></td>
<td>

<p>A sequence of powers to try for x and y.  By default this ranges from -3 to 3 in steps of 0.25.  If 0 is a valid power, then the logarithm is used instead.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threshold</code></td>
<td>

<p>Report all models that have an R2 that is within <code>threshold</code> of the model with the highest R2 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>Additional arguments to <code>plot</code> such as <code>pch</code> and <code>cex</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The relationship between y and x may not be linear.  However, some transformation of y may have a linear relationship with some transformation of x.  This function considers simple linear regression with x and y raised to powers between -3 and 3 (in 0.25 increments) by default.  The function outputs a list of the top models as gauged by R^2 (all models within 0.02 of the highest R^2).  Note:  there is no guarantee that these "best" transformations are actually good, since a large R^2 can be produced by outliers created during transformations.  A plot of the transformation is also provided.
</p>
<p>It is exceedingly rare that the "best" transformation is raising x and y to the 1 power (i.e., the original variables).  Transformations are typically used only when there are issues in the residuals plots, highly skewed variables, or physical/logical justifications.
</p>
<p>Note:  if a variable has 0s or negative numbers, only integer transformations are considered.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  #Straightforward example
  data(BULLDOZER)
	M &lt;- lm(SalePrice~YearMade,data=BULLDOZER)
	find_transformations(M,pch=20,cex=0.3)

  #Results are very misleading since selected models have high R2 due to outliers
  data(MOVIE)
  M &lt;- lm(Total~Weekend,data=MOVIE)
	find_transformations(M,powers=seq(-2,2,by=0.5),threshold=0.05)
