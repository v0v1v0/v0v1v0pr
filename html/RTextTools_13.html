<h2>Query the languages supported in this package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dynamically determines the names of the languages
for which stemming is supported by this package.
This is controlled when the package is created (not installed)
by downloading the  stemming algorithms for the different
languages.
</p>
<p>This language support requires more support for Unicode
and more complex text than simple strings.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">getStemLanguages()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This queries the C code for the list of languages that
were compiled when the package was installed
which in turn is determined by the code that was
included in the distributed package itself.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A character vector giving the names of the
languages.
