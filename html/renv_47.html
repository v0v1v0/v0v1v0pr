<h2>The default library sandbox</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> installation can have up to three types of library paths available
to the user:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The <em>user library</em>, where <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> packages downloaded and installed by the
current user are installed. This library path is only visible to that
specific user.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The <em>site library</em>, where <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> packages maintained by administrators of a
system are installed. This library path, if it exists, is visible to all
users on the system.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The <em>default library</em>, where <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> packages distributed with <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> itself are
installed. This library path is visible to all users on the system.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, only so-called "base" and "recommended" packages should be installed
in the default library. (You can get a list of these packages with
<code>installed.packages(priority = c("base", "recommended"))</code>). However, it is
possible for users and administrators to install packages into the default
library, if the filesystem permissions permit them to do so. (This, for
example, is the default behavior on macOS.)
</p>
<p>Because the site and default libraries are visible to all users, having those
accessible in renv projects can potentially break isolation â€“ that is,
if a package were updated in the default library, that update would be visible
to all <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> projects on the system.
</p>
<p>To help defend against this, renv uses something called the "sandbox" to
isolate renv projects from non-"base" packages that are installed into the
default library. When an renv project is loaded, renv will:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Create a new, empty library path (called the "sandbox"),
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Link only the "base" and "recommended" packages from the default library
into the sandbox,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Mark the sandbox as read-only, so that users are unable to install packages
into this library,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Instruct the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> session to use the "sandbox" as the default library.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This process is mostly transparent to the user. However, because the sandbox
is read-only, if you later need to remove the sandbox, you'll need to reset
file permissions manually; for example, with <code>renv::sandbox$unlock()</code>.
</p>
<p>If you'd prefer to keep the sandbox unlocked, you can also set:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>RENV_SANDBOX_LOCKING_ENABLED = FALSE
</pre></div>
<p>in an appropriate startup <code>.Renviron</code> or <code>Renviron.site</code> file.
</p>
<p>The sandbox can also be disabled entirely with:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>RENV_CONFIG_SANDBOX_ENABLED = FALSE
</pre></div>
<p>The sandbox library path can also be configured using the <code>RENV_PATHS_SANDBOX</code>
environment variable: see paths for more details.
