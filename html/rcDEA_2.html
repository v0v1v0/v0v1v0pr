<h2>Conditional DEA function</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows to compute Robust and Conditional DEA scores.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">conditional_DEA(
  input,
  output,
  exogenous = FALSE,
  alpha = FALSE,
  m,
  B,
  RTS = "crs",
  ORIENTATION = "in",
  similarity = FALSE,
  inclusion = FALSE,
  print = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>input</code></td>
<td>
<p>matrix (or vector) of inputs along which the units are evaluated.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<td>
<p>matrix (or vector) of outputs along which the units are evaluated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>exogenous</code></td>
<td>
<p>matrix (or vector) of exogenous variables involved in the conditional analysis. The similarity among the units is determined according to the exogeneous variable(s) using the function npudensbw and npudens (from the package np) with epanechnikov kernel.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>This allow to choose the size of the Confidence Intervals computed. By defaulta alpha = FALSE. In this case no confidence interval are computed</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of unit to be included in the reference set</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>B</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of bootstrap replicates</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>similarity</code></td>
<td>
<p>matrix of similarities. In alternative to provide the exogenous variables, the matrix of similarities can be directly provided. This allow to customize the estimation of the similarities.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>inclusion</code></td>
<td>
<p>If inclusion = TRUE the unit under analysis is included in the reference set. So, no super efficient scores are allowed. By default inclusion = FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>print</code></td>
<td>
<p>If print = TRUE the number of the unit under evaluation is printed. In case of large sample the function could require some time, so it could be useful to control how many units have already been evaluated and which one still have to be evaluated. By default print = FALSE.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If the parameter alpha is specified, the function returns a data frame with three numeric columns.
The first column is the vector representing the conditional DEA scores (eff);
the second column is the vector representing the lower bound of the condifence interval (ci_low);
the third column is the vector representing the upper bound of the confidence interval (Ci_up).
If alpha is not specified, the functions returns only the first column of the data frame (eff).
