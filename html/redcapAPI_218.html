<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Maintaining consistent functionality for all types of REDCap projects
requires that errors be handled delicately.  It is not always desirable for an
error from the API to terminate the program.  One example of such a case is when
a user executes the <code>exportEvents</code> function for a classic project;
doing so returns an error from the API that events cannot be exported for
classic projects.  In REDCap versions earlier than 6.5.0, there is no way to
determine if a project is classic or longitudinal without attempting to export
the events.
</p>
<p>For this reason, it is often preferable to have these kinds of errors return
<code>NULL</code> so that the program does not crash if it does not need to (one such
instance where it does not need to crash is when <code>exportEvents</code> is called
within <code>exportRecords</code>; the <code>events</code> argument is irrelevant to a
classic project and the error can safely be ignored.
</p>
<p>The other common type of error that does not need to be fatal is when a
<code>redcapAPI</code> method is sent to a REDCap instance that does not support the
method.  For example, the <code>exportVersion</code> method is not supported in
REDCap instances earlier than 6.0.0.  In these cases, we may prefer not to cast
a hard error.
</p>
<p>These two types of errors may be handled in one of two ways.  When the
error handler is set to <code>"null"</code>, a <code>NULL</code> is returned.  When the
error handler is set to <code>"error"</code>, the error is returned.  The option
is set globally using <code>options(redcap_error_handler = "null")</code> and is
set to <code>"null"</code> by default.
