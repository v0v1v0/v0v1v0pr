<h2>Twins Income and Education Levels Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data were collected at the 16th Annual Twins Day Festival in
Twinsburg, Ohio, in August 1991. 495 adult twins were interviewed. The
original study aimed to investigate
'By how much will another year of schooling most likely raise one's income?'
Pairs of twins provide a control on confounding factors such as intelligence,
family background, etc.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>There are 183 cases; 147 complete cases.

For data analysis, the logarithm of the hourly wage is typically used instead of hourly wage.
