<h2>Fast Greedy Set Cover</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package offers an implementation of the greedy algorithm for the set cover problem using Rcpp.
</p>


<h3>Set Cover Problem</h3>

<p>We are given a universe of elements <em>U</em> and <em>F</em>, 
a collection of subsets from <em>U</em>, covering <em>U</em>; i.e. <em>U</em> is 
in the union of the sets in <em>F</em>.
The objective is to find <em>A</em>, the smallest subcollection of <em>F</em>, covering <em>U</em>.
An important application is hospital placement, where the 
number of hospitals is minimized under the constraint that all residents are provided for.
</p>
<p>The optimal solution to the problem is available via linear programming, 
however this is not a feasible solution for large 
problems due to the computational demands involved. 
A quick approximate solution is given by the greedy algorithm. 
The algorithm iterates the following steps until all elements are covered, 
starting from an empty <em>A</em>:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Add the largest set of uncovered elements to <em>A</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Remove covered elements from <em>F</em>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This simple algorithm exhibits surprisingly good properties. 
For a nice introduction to the set cover problem and the greedy algorithm see Vazirani, 2001.
