<h2>Package R.oo</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Methods and classes for object-oriented programming in R with or without references.  Large effort has been made on making definition of methods as simple as possible with a minimum of maintenance for package developers.  The package has been developed since 2001 and is now considered very stable.  This is a cross-platform package implemented in pure R that defines standard S3 classes without any tricks.
</p>
<p>Please note that the Rdoc syntax/grammar used to convert Rdoc comments
in code into Rd files is not strictly defined and is modified by the
need of the author. Ideally, there will be a well defined Rdoc language
one day.
</p>


<h3>Installation and updates</h3>

<p>To install this package do<br></p>
<p><code>install.packages("R.oo")</code>
</p>


<h3>Dependencies and other requirements</h3>

<p>This package requires a standard <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> installation and
the <span class="pkg">R.methodsS3</span> package.
</p>


<h3>To get started</h3>

<p>To get started,It is very useful to understand that:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> The <code>setMethodS3</code>() function, which is
defined in the <span class="pkg">R.methodsS3</span> package (used to be part of
<span class="pkg">R.oo</span>), is nothing but a conveniency wrapper for setting
up S3 methods, and automatically create an S3 generic
function, if missing.  For more information, see the help of
<span class="pkg">R.methodsS3</span>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The <code>Object</code> class is a top-level "root" class
that provides support for <em>reference variables</em>.
Any class inheriting from this class supports
reference variables.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The <code>Object</code> class is basically a wrapper around an
<code>environment</code>, which some additional accessors etc.  It is the
environment data type that provides the "emulation" of
reference variables - the Object class structure makes
it easier to extends this class and adds some level of coding
protection.  The Object class features is not intended for
referencing individual elements of basic <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> data types,
but rather for the whole variable of such.
For instance, you can reassign a whole matrix <code>X</code> part of
the object this way, but you cannot reassign <code>X[1,1]</code>
without creating a completely new copy.
