<h2>KitchenhamEtAl.CorrelationsAmongParticipants.Romano18ESEM data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data illustrate correlations between results from individual participants in a cross-over
experiment conducted by Romano et al.:
[1] S. Romano, G. Scanniello, D. Fucci, N. Juristo, and B. Turhan, 'The effect of noise on
software engineers’ performance', in Proceedings of the 12th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on
Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement, ser. ESEM'18, 2018.
The experiments assess whether noise has an impact on the performance of software engineers.

of the Correlation between Results from Individual Participants in Crossover Experiments'

The experiment had two parts but Kitchenham et al. only use the data from the first part of the experiment.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 194 and 10 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>ExperimentID</dt>
<dd>
<p>&lt;fct&gt;|ExperimentID: A unique identifier for each part of the experiment.
Exp.1 identifies data from the first part of the experiment, Exp.2 identifies data from the
second part of the experiment.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ParticipantID</dt>
<dd>
<p>&lt;fct&gt;|Participant ID: An identifier for each participant, unique for both
parts of the experiment.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SequenceGroup</dt>
<dd>
<p>&lt;fct&gt;|Experimental Sequence Group: A , B </p>
</dd>
<dt>System</dt>
<dd>
<p>&lt;fct&gt;|Software systems used in the experiment: For the first part of the
experiment, M-Shop (a system for managing a music shop) and Theater (a system for managing
theatre reservations). For the second part of the experiment: AveCalc (a system that manages as
electronic register and LaTazza  (a system for a drinks vending machine)  </p>
</dd>
<dt>Period</dt>
<dd>
<p>&lt;fct&gt;|Time period of the cross-over experiment: 1 or 2</p>
</dd>
<dt>Treatment</dt>
<dd>
<p>&lt;fct&gt;|Experimental Treatment: NOISE, participants were asked to perform a
comprehension task in a noisy environment.
NORMAL, participants were asked to perform a comprehension task under normal working conditions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Fc</dt>
<dd>
<p>&lt;dbl&gt;|Dependent variable: the balanced F-measure which represents the trade-off
between  precision and recall, measured in the first part of the experiment.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Avg</dt>
<dd>
<p>&lt;dbl&gt;|Dependent variable: The average number of fully correct answers, measured in
the first part of the experiment. </p>
</dd>
<dt>Ff</dt>
<dd>
<p>&lt;dbl&gt;|Dependent variable: Effectiveness of fault correction. Measured in the second
part of the experiment. </p>
</dd>
<dt>CrossOverID</dt>
<dd>
<p>&lt;fct&gt;|CrossOver category: For 4 group crossovers, the crossover category
specifies the matching pairs of sequence groups, CO1 and CO2. For 2 group crossover, the
category is set to CO1 only.</p>
