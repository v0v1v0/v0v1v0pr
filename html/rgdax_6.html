<h2>Cancel Pending Orders</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is an auth based function. User must have valid api keys generated by GDAX which must be passed as mandatory arguments. The users can cancel all pending orders except stop orders (GDAX does not treat STOP order as an open order unless the stop price is kicked in). User can now pass an optional order id to cancel a specific order including stop orders. Open orders can now be determined with <code>open_orders</code>. This function is a common call to delete one individual order or deleting all open orders.
