<h2>Perform an enrichment test.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate the p-value of occurrence of an overlap between two sets by chance.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S4 method for signature 'Venn'
enrichment_test(venn, set1, set2, univ = "all",
  n = 10000, seed = 42)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>venn</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Required) A <code>Venn</code> object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>set1</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Required) The name or the index of the set of interest.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>set2</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Required) The name or the index of the set to be checked whether
enriched in <code>set1</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>univ</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Optional) Population size. Default is "all", implying the union
of all the sets in the <code>Venn</code> object will be used. Another set as the
whole population can be assigned as well.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Optional) Number of randomly generated sets. Default is 10,000 and
minimum is 1,000.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>seed</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Optional) An integer passed to set.seed function. It is
used to fix a seed for reproducibly random number generation. Default is
42.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This type of analysis can also be performed by hypergeometric test or
Fisher's exact test. Here, the approach is similar to that described in
(<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tpj.13261">Austin et
al., 2016</a>). Briefly, the test is based on randomly generation of sets with
equal size to <code>set1</code> from the background (universal) set. After creating
n (default is 10,000) random sets, the overlap between these and <code>set2</code>
is calculated to make a null distribution. When this distribution is true,
the probability of seeing an overlap at least as extreme as what was observed
(overlap between <code>set1</code> and <code>set2</code>) will be returned as the
p-value.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a list containing the probability (Significance) of occurrence
of an overlap between two sets by chance and the number of occurrences
(Overlap_Counts) in randomly generated sets.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">set1 = c(1:20, letters[1:10])
set2 = letters[-26]
univ = unique(c(set1, set2, 21:200))
venn = Venn(list(set1, set2, univ))
e = enrichment_test(venn, 1, 2)
e$Significance
