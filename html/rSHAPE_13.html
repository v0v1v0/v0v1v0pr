<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function uses the exponential growth model and can either calculated the expected growth for a single time step
OR it can work backwards to calculated what was the expected starting population size prior to a step of exponential growth.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">expGrowth(func_rate, func_step, func_startPop = NULL,
  func_endPop = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func_rate</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the number of offpsring expected to be produced by an individual.  When calculating the expected
population size after a time step, we force this rate to be no less than 1 since this function has meaning only in the birth
function and so we do not want to calculate negative births (which would mean deaths).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func_step</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is a proportional scalar that will control what proportion of a standard
"generation" is simulated for each step within a SHAPE run.  NOTE: This parameter is not perfectly
validated to run as may be expected with all models.  For now, it should be left as a value of "1",
but exists for future implementation and testing.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func_startPop</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the initial population size(s) for which you want to calculate a final size.  Leave NULL
if trying to calculated the expected initial size from a final population.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func_endPop</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the final population size(s) for which you want to calculate a initial size.  Leave NULL
if trying to calculated the expected final size from an initial population.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>numeric value

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Exponential growth equation implemented but allowing either the final or initial population
# to be calculated based on whethere the initial or final community size is input.
expGrowth(func_rate = 2, func_step = 1,func_startPop = 100)
expGrowth(func_rate = 2, func_step = 1,func_endPop = 200)
expGrowth(func_rate = 2, func_step = 7,func_startPop = 100)
# You cannot set a growth rate less than 1 as this would then simulate deaths which is not
# allowed in this calculation.
expGrowth(func_rate = c(0.9,1,1.1), func_step = 1,func_startPop = 100)
