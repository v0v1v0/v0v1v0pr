<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Modified version of the algorithm of Rada and Cerny (2018).
The main modifications include preprocessing as hyperplanes are added
to determine which new cells are created, thereby reducing the number of
calls to the witness function to solve LPs, and treatment of degenerate
configurations as well as those in "general position." (for <code class="reqn">d=2</code> for now).  When the hyperplanes
are in general position the number of cells (polytopes) is determined by the
elegant formula of Zaslavsky (1975) </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">m = {n \choose d} + n + 1</code>
</p>
<p>.  In
degenerate cases, i.e. when hyperplanes are not in general position, the
number of cells is more complicated as considered by Alexanderson and Wetzel (1981).
The function <code>polycount</code> is provided to check agreement with their results
in an effort to aid in the selection of tolerances for the <code>witness</code> function for arrangement in <code class="reqn">d=2</code>.
The current version is intended mainly for use with <code class="reqn">d = 2</code>, but the algorithm is adapted to
the general position setting with <code class="reqn">d &gt; 2</code>, although it requires hyperplanes in general position and may require some patience when both
the sample size is large.
if hyperplanes not general position (i.e. all cross at origin), turn off accelerate
