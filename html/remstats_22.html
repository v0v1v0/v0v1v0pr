<h2>inertia</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Specifies the statistic for an inertia effect in the tie-oriented model or
the receiver choice step of the actor-oriented model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">inertia(scaling = c("none", "prop", "std"), consider_type = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scaling</code></td>
<td>
<p>the method for scaling the inertia statistic. Default is to
not scale the statistic (scaling = "none"). Alternatively, the
statistics can be scaled by specifying 'prop', in which raw counts are
divided by the outdegree of the sender at time t (see 'details') or
standardization of the raw counts per time point can be requested with 'std'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>consider_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, indicates whether to count the number of past
events separately for each event type (TRUE, default) or sum across
different event types (FALSE).</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An inertia effect refers to the tendency for dyads to repeatedly interact
with each other (tie-oriented model) or for actors to repeatedly choose the
same actor as receiver of their events (actor-oriented model). The statistic
at timepoint <em>t</em> for dyad <em>(i,j)</em> resp. receiver <em>j</em> is
equal to the number of <em>(i,j)</em> events before timepoint <em>t</em>.
</p>
<p>Optionally, a scaling method can be set with <code>scaling</code>. By scaling the
inertia count by the outdegree of the sender ("prop"), the statistic refers
to the fraction of messages send by actor i that were send to actor j. If
actor i hasn't send any messages yet it can be assumed that every actor is
equally likely to receive a message from i and the statistic is set equal to
1/(n-1), where n refers to the number of actors. The resulting statistic is
similar to the "FrPSndSnd" statistic in the R package 'relevent', or the
persistence statistic in Section 2.2.2 of Butts (2008). Note that this
scaling method is only defined for directed events.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>List with all information required by 'remstats::remstats()' to 
compute the statistic.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">reh_tie &lt;- remify::remify(history, model = "tie")
effects &lt;- ~ inertia()
remstats(reh = reh_tie, tie_effects = effects)

reh_actor &lt;- remify::remify(history, model = "actor")
remstats(reh = reh_actor, receiver_effects = effects)

</code></pre>
