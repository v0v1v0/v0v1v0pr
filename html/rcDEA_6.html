<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows to draw a graph that relates the average efficiency score and the choice of m

<td><code>print</code></td>
<td>
<p>If print = TRUE, the number of the unit under evaluation is printed. In case of large sample the function could require some time, so it could be useful to control how many units have already been evaluated and which one still have to be evaluated. By default print = FALSE.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function return a plot representing the average score from the robust analysis for the different values of m chosen.
