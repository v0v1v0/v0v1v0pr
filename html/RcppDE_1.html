<h2>Differential Evolution Optimization</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Performs evolutionary global optimization via the Differential Evolution algorithm.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">DEoptim(fn, lower, upper, control = DEoptim.control(), ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fn</code></td>
<td>
<p>the function to be optimized (minimized). The function should have as its first 
argument the vector of real-valued parameters to optimize, and return a scalar real result. <code>NA</code> 
and <code>NaN</code> values are not allowed. Note that <code>fn</code> can also
be an external pointer object encapsulating a C/C++-level function pointer
to a compiled functions which may offer considerable speed improvements.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lower, upper</code></td>
<td>
<p>two vectors specifying scalar real lower and upper bounds on each parameter to be optimized, so that the i-th element 
of <code>lower</code> and <code>upper</code> applied to the i-th parameter. The implementation searches
between <code>lower</code> and <code>upper</code> for the global optimum (minimum) of <code>fn</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>DEoptim</code> performs optimization (minimization) of <code>fn</code>. 
</p>
<p>The <code>control</code> argument is a list; see the help file for
<code>DEoptim.control</code> for details.
</p>
<p>The <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> implementation of Differential Evolution (DE), <span class="pkg">DEoptim</span>, was first published on the Comprehensive <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> Archive
Network (CRAN) in 2005 by David Ardia. Early versions were written in 
pure <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>. Since version 2.0-0 (published to CRAN in 2009) the package has relied on an
interface to a C implementation of DE, which is significantly 
faster on most problems as compared to the implementation in 
pure <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>. The C interface is in many respects similar to the MS
Visual C++ v5.0 implementation of the Differential Evolution algorithm
distributed with the book <em>Differential Evolution â€“ A Practical
Approach to Global Optimization</em> by Price, K.V., Storn, R.M., Lampinen
J.A, Springer-Verlag, 2006. Since version 2.0-3 the C 
implementation dynamically allocates the memory required to store the population, removing limitations on the 
number of members in the population and length of the parameter vectors that may be optimized. 
Since becoming publicly available, the package <span class="pkg">DEoptim</span> has been used by several authors to solve optimization 
problems arising in diverse domains; see Mullen et al. (2009) for a review.
</p>
<p>To perform a maximization (instead of minimization) of a given
function, simply define a new function which is the opposite of the
function to maximize and apply <code>DEoptim</code> to it.
</p>
<p>To integrate additional constraints (than box constraints) on the parameters <code>x</code> of
<code>fn(x)</code>, for instance <code>x[1] + x[2]^2 &lt; 2</code>, integrate the
constraint within the function to optimize, for instance: 
</p>
<pre>
    fn &lt;- function(x){
      if (x[1] + x[2]^2 &lt; 2){
        r &lt;- Inf
      else{
        ...
      }
      return(r)
    }
  </pre>
<p>This simplistic strategy usually does not work all that well for gradient-based or Newton-type 
methods. It is likely to be alright when the solution is in the interior of the feasible region, but when 
the solution is on the boundary, optimization algorithm would have a difficult time converging. Furthermore, when
the solution is on the boundary, this strategy would make the algorithm converge to an inferior solution in the interior. 
However, for methods such as DE which are not gradient based, this strategy might not be that bad.
</p>
<p>Note that <code>DEoptim</code> stops if any <code>NA</code> or <code>NaN</code> value is
obtained. You have to redefine your function to handle these values
(for instance, set <code>NA</code> to <code>Inf</code> in your objective function).
</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that the result of <code>DEoptim</code> is a random variable, 
i.e., different results will obtain when the algorithm is run repeatedly with the same 
settings. Hence, the user should set the random seed if they want to reproduce the results, e.g., by 
setting <code>set.seed(1234)</code> before the call of <code>DEoptim</code>.
</p>
<p><code>DEoptim</code> relies on repeated evaluation of the objective function
in order to move the population toward a global minimum. Users
interested in making <code>DEoptim</code> run as fast as possible should
ensure that evaluation of the objective function is as efficient as
possible. Using pure <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> code, this may often be accomplished
using vectorization. Writing parts of the objective function in a
lower-level language like C or Fortran may also increase speed.
</p>
<p>Further details and examples of the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> package <span class="pkg">DEoptim</span> can be found
in Mullen et al. (2009) and Ardia et al. (2010).

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The output of the function <code>DEoptim</code> is a member of the <code>S3</code> class <code>DEoptim</code>. More precisely,
this is a list (of length 2) containing the following elements:<br></p>
<p><code>optim</code>, a list containing the following elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>bestmem</code>: the best set of parameters found.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>bestval</code>: the value of <code>fn</code> corresponding to <code>bestmem</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>nfeval</code>: number of function evaluations.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>iter</code>: number of procedure iterations.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>member</code>, a list containing the following elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>lower</code>: the lower boundary.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>upper</code>: the upper boundary.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>bestvalit</code>: the best value of <code>fn</code> at each iteration.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>bestmemit</code>: the best member at each iteration.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>pop</code>: the population generated at the last iteration.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>storepop</code>: a list containing the intermediate populations.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Members of the class <code>DEoptim</code> have a <code>plot</code> method that
accepts the argument <code>plot.type</code>. <code>plot.type = "bestmemit"</code> results
in a plot of the parameter values that represent the lowest value of the objective function
each generation. <code>plot.type = "bestvalit"</code> plots the best value of
the objective function each generation. Finally, <code>plot.type = "storepop"</code> results in a plot of
stored populations (which are only available if these have been saved by
setting the <code>control</code> argument of <code>DEoptim</code> appropriately). Storing intermediate populations 
allows us to examine the progress of the optimization in detail.   
A summary method also exists and returns the best parameter vector, the best value of the objective function,
the number of generations optimization ran, and the number of times the 
objective function was evaluated.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p><em>Differential Evolution</em> (DE) is a search heuristic introduced by Storn and Price (1997). 
Its remarkable performance as a global optimization algorithm on continuous numerical minimization 
problems has been extensively explored; see Price et al. (2006). DE belongs to the class of genetic 
algorithms which use biology-inspired operations of 
crossover, mutation, and selection on a population in order to minimize an objective 
function over the course of successive generations (see Mitchell, 1998). As with other evolutionary algorithms, 
DE solves optimization problems by evolving a population of candidate solutions using alteration and selection
operators. DE uses floating-point instead of bit-string encoding of population members, and 
arithmetic operations instead of logical operations in mutation. DE is particularly well-suited to find the global optimum of a 
real-valued function of real-valued parameters, and does not require that the function be
either continuous or differentiable.
</p>
<p>Let <code class="reqn">\mathit{NP}</code> denote the number of parameter vectors (members) <code class="reqn">x \in R^d</code> in the population. 
In order to create the initial generation, <code class="reqn">\mathit{NP}</code> guesses for the optimal value
of the parameter vector are made, either using random values between lower and upper 
bounds (defined by the user) or using values given by
the user. Each generation involves creation of a new population from
the current population members <code class="reqn">\{ x_i \,|\, i = 1, \ldots, \mathit{NP}\}</code>, 
where <code class="reqn">i</code> indexes the vectors that make up the population.
This is accomplished using <em>differential mutation</em> of the
population members. An initial mutant parameter vector <code class="reqn">v_i</code> is
created by choosing three members of the population, <code class="reqn">x_{r_0}</code>,
<code class="reqn">x_{r_1}</code> and <code class="reqn">x_{r_2}</code>, at random. Then <code class="reqn">v_i</code> is
generated as
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">v_i \doteq x_{r_0} + \mathit{F} \cdot (x_{r_1} - x_{r_2})</code>
</p>
  
<p>where <code class="reqn">\mathit{F}</code> is a positive scale factor, effective values for which are
typically less than one. After the first mutation operation, mutation is
continued until <code class="reqn">d</code> mutations have been made, with a crossover probability 
<code class="reqn">\mathit{CR} \in [0,1]</code>.
The crossover probability <code class="reqn">\mathit{CR}</code> controls the fraction of the parameter
values that are copied from the mutant. If an element of the trial parameter vector is found to violate the
bounds after mutation and crossover, it is reset in such a way that the bounds are respected (with the
specific protocol depending on the implementation).
Then, the objective function values associated with the children are determined. If a trial
vector has equal or lower objective function value than the previous
vector it replaces the previous vector in the population;
otherwise the previous vector remains. Variations of this scheme have also
been proposed; see Price et al. (2006) and <code>DEoptim.control</code>.
</p>
<p>Intuitively, the effect of the scheme is that the shape of the distribution of the population in the
search space is converging with respect to size and direction towards areas with high
fitness. The closer the population gets to the global optimum, the more the distribution
will shrink and therefore reinforce the generation of smaller difference vectors.  
</p>
<p>As a general advice regarding the choice of <code class="reqn">\mathit{NP}</code>, <code class="reqn">\mathit{F}</code> and <code class="reqn">\mathit{CR}</code>, 
Storn et al. (2006) state the following: Set the number
of parents <code class="reqn">\mathit{NP}</code> to 10 times the number of parameters, select weighting factor 
<code class="reqn">\mathit{F} = 0.8</code> and crossover constant <code class="reqn">\mathit{CR} = 0.9</code>. Make sure that you initialize your parameter vectors
by exploiting their full numerical range, i.e., if a parameter is allowed to exhibit
values in the range [-100, 100] it is a good idea to pick the initial values from this
range instead of unnecessarily restricting diversity. If you experience misconvergence in 
the optimization process you usually have to increase the value for <code class="reqn">\mathit{NP}</code>, but often you only have to adjust
<code class="reqn">\mathit{F}</code> to be a little lower or higher than 0.8. If you increase
<code class="reqn">\mathit{NP}</code> and simultaneously lower <code class="reqn">\mathit{F}</code> a little, convergence is more
likely to occur but generally takes longer, i.e., DE is getting
more robust (there is always a convergence speed/robustness trade-off).
</p>
<p>DE is much more sensitive to the choice of <code class="reqn">\mathit{F}</code> than it is to
the choice of <code class="reqn">\mathit{CR}</code>. <code class="reqn">\mathit{CR}</code> is more like a fine tuning element. High
values of <code class="reqn">\mathit{CR}</code> like <code class="reqn">\mathit{CR} = 1</code> give faster convergence if convergence
occurs. Sometimes, however, you have to go down as much as <code class="reqn">\mathit{CR} = 0</code> to
make DE robust enough for a particular problem. For more details on the DE strategy, we refer 
the reader to Storn and Price (1997) and Price et al. (2006).
