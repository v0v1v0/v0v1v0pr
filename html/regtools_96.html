<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data is suitable for NLP analysis.  It consists of all the quizzes
I've given in undergraduate courses, 143 quizzes in all.  
</p>
<p>It is available in two forms.  First, <code>quizzes</code> is a data.frame,
143 rows and 2 columns.  Row i consists of a single character vector
comprising the entire quiz i, followed by the course name (as an R
factor).  The second form is an R list, 143 elements.  Each list element
is a character vector, one vector element per line of the quiz.
</p>
<p>The original documents were LaTeX files.  They have been run through the
<code>detex</code> utility to remove most LaTeX commands, as well as removing
the LaTeX preambles separately.
</p>
<p>The names of the list elements are the course names, as follows:
</p>
<p>ECS 50:  a course in machine organization
</p>
<p>ECS 132:  an undergraduate course in probabilistic modeling
</p>
<p>ECS 145:  a course in scripting languages (Python, R)
</p>
<p>ECS 158:  an undergraduate course in parallel computation
</p>
<p>ECS 256:  a graduate course in probabilistic modeling
</p>
