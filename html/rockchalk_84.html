<h2>Extracts non-numeric variables, calculates summary information,
including entropy as a diversity indicator.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function finds the non- numeric variables and ignores the
others. (See <code>summarizeNumerics</code> for a function that
handles numeric variables.)  It then treats all non-numeric
variables as if they were factors, and summarizes each. The main
benefits from this compared to R's default summary are 1) more
summary information is returned for each variable (entropy
estimates ofdispersion), 2) the columns in the output are
alphabetized. To prevent alphabetization, use alphaSort = FALSE.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">summarizeFactors(
  dat = NULL,
  maxLevels = 5,
  alphaSort = TRUE,
  stats = c("entropy", "normedEntropy", "nobs", "nmiss"),
  digits = 2
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dat</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxLevels</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum number of levels that will be
reported.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alphaSort</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE (default), the columns are re-organized
in alphabetical order. If FALSE, they are presented in the
original order.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stats</code></td>
<td>
<p>Default is <code>c("nobs", "nmiss", "entropy",
"normedEntropy")</code>.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>digits</code></td>
<td>
<p>Default 2.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Entropy is one possible measure of diversity. If all outcomes are
equally likely, the entropy is maximized, while if all outcomes
fall into one possible category, entropy is at its lowest
values. The lowest possible value for entropy is 0, while the
maximum value is dependent on the number of categories. Entropy is
also called Shannon's information index in some fields of study
(Balch, 2000 ; Shannon, 1949 ).
</p>
<p>Concerning the use of entropy as a diversity index, the user might
consult Balch(). For each possible outcome category, let p
represent the observed proportion of cases. The diversity
contribution of each category is -p * log2(p). Note that if p is
either 0 or 1, the diversity contribution is 0.  The sum of those
diversity contributions across possible outcomes is the entropy
estimate. The entropy value is a lower bound of 0, but there is no
upper bound that is independent of the number of possible
categories. If m is the number of categories, the maximum possible
value of entropy is -log2(1/m).
</p>
<p>Because the maximum value of entropy depends on the number of
possible categories, some scholars wish to re-scale so as to bring
the values into a common numeric scale. The normed entropy is
calculated as the observed entropy divided by the maximum possible
entropy.  Normed entropy takes on values between 0 and 1, so in a
sense, its values are more easily comparable. However, the
comparison is something of an illusion, since variables with the
same number of categories will always be comparable by their
entropy, whether it is normed or not.
</p>
<p>Warning: Variables of class POSIXt will be ignored. This will be
fixed in the future. The function works perfectly well with
numeric, factor, or character variables.  Other more elaborate
structures are likely to be trouble.
