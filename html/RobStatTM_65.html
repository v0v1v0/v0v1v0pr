<h2>Vehicle data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The original data set contains an ensemble of shape feature extractors to the
2D silhouettes of different vehicles. The purpose is to classify a given
silhouette as one of four types of vehicle, using a set of 18 features extracted
from the silhouette. Here we deal with the "van" type, which has 217 cases.
Description; The following features were extracted from the silhouettes.
1. compactness
2. circularity
3. distance circularity
4. radius ratio
5. principal axis aspect ratio
6. maximum length aspect ratio
7. scatter ratio
8. elongatedness
9. principal axis rectangularity
10. maximum length rectangularity
11. scaled variance along major axis
12. scaled variance along minor axis
13. scaled radius of gyration
14. skewness about major axis
15. skewness about minor axis
16. kurtosis about minor axis
17. kurtosis about major axis
18. hollows ratio
