<h2>Initiate and maintain an isolated, project-specific, and runtime-pure R
setup via Nix.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates an isolated project folder for a Nix-R configuration.
<code>rix::rix_init()</code> also adds, appends, or updates with or without backup a
custom <code>.Rprofile</code> file with code that initializes a startup R environment
without system's user libraries within a Nix software environment. Instead,
it restricts search paths to load R packages exclusively from the Nix store.
Additionally, it makes Nix utilities like <code>nix-shell</code> available to run system
commands from the system's RStudio R session, for both Linux and macOS.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rix_init(
  project_path,
  rprofile_action = c("create_missing", "create_backup", "overwrite", "append"),
  message_type = c("simple", "quiet", "verbose")
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>project_path</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character with the folder path to the isolated nix-R
project. If the folder does not exist yet, it will be created.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rprofile_action</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character. Action to take with <code>.Rprofile</code> file
destined for <code>project_path</code> folder. Possible values include
<code>"create_missing"</code>, which only writes <code>.Rprofile</code> if it does not yet exist
(otherwise does nothing) - this is the action set when using <code>rix()</code> - ;
<code>"create_backup"</code>, which copies the existing <code>.Rprofile</code> to a new backup
file, generating names with POSIXct-derived strings that include the time
zone information. A new <code>.Rprofile</code> file will be written with default code
from <code>rix::rix_init()</code>; <code>"overwrite"</code> overwrites the <code>.Rprofile</code> file if it
does exist; <code>"append"</code> appends the existing file with code that is tailored
to an isolated Nix-R project setup.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>message_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character. Message type, defaults to <code>"simple"</code>, which
gives minimal but sufficient feedback. Other values are currently <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠"quiet⁠</code>,
which writes <code>.Rprofile</code> without message, and <code>"verbose"</code>, which displays
the mechanisms implemented to achieve fully controlled R project
environments in Nix.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Enhancement of computational reproducibility for Nix-R environments:</strong>
</p>
<p>The primary goal of <code>rix::rix_init()</code> is to enhance the computational
reproducibility of Nix-R environments during runtime. Concretely, if you
already have a system or user library of R packages (if you have R installed
through the usual means for your operating system), using <code>rix::rix_init()</code>
will prevent Nix-R environments to load packages from the user library which
would cause issues. Notably, no restart is required as environmental
variables are set in the current session, in addition to writing an
<code>.Rprofile</code> file. This is particularly useful to make <code>with_nix()</code>
evaluate custom R functions from any "Nix-to-Nix" or "System-to-Nix" R
setups. It introduces two side-effects that take effect both in a current or
later R session setup:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><strong>Adjusting <code>R_LIBS_USER</code> path:</strong>
By default, the first path of <code>R_LIBS_USER</code> points to the user library
outside the Nix store (see also <code>base::.libPaths()</code>). This creates
friction and potential impurity as R packages from the system's R user
library are loaded. While this feature can be useful for interactively
testing an R package in a Nix environment before adding it to a <code>.nix</code>
configuration, it can have undesired effects if not managed carefully.
A major drawback is that all R packages in the <code>R_LIBS_USER</code> location need
to be cleaned to avoid loading packages outside the Nix configuration.
Issues, especially on macOS, may arise due to segmentation faults or
incompatible linked system libraries. These problems can also occur
if one of the (reverse) dependencies of an R package is loaded  along the
process.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Make Nix commands available when running system commands from RStudio:</strong>
In a host RStudio session not launched via Nix (<code>nix-shell</code>), the
environmental variables from <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠~/.zshrc⁠</code> or <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠~/.bashrc⁠</code> may not be
inherited. Consequently, Nix command line interfaces like <code>nix-shell</code>
might not be found. The <code>.Rprofile</code> code written by <code>rix::rix_init()</code>
ensures that Nix command line programs are accessible by adding the path
of the "bin" directory of the default Nix profile,
<code>"/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bin"</code>, to the <code>PATH</code> variable in an
RStudio R session.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These side effects are particularly recommended when working in flexible R
environments, especially for users who want to maintain both the system's
native R setup and utilize Nix expressions for reproducible development
environments. This init configuration is considered pivotal to enhance the
adoption of Nix in the R community, particularly until RStudio in Nixpkgs is
packaged for macOS. We recommend calling <code>rix::rix_init()</code> prior to comparing R
code ran between two software environments with <code>rix::with_nix()</code>.
</p>
<p><code>rix::rix_init()</code> is called automatically by <code>rix::rix()</code> when generating a
<code>default.nix</code> file, and when called by <code>rix::rix()</code> will only add the <code>.Rprofile</code>
if none exists. In case you have a custom <code>.Rprofile</code> that you wish to keep
using, but also want to benefit from what <code>rix_init()</code> offers, manually call
it and set the <code>rprofile_action</code> to <code>"append"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Nothing, this function only has the side-effect of writing a file
called ".Rprofile" to the specified path.
