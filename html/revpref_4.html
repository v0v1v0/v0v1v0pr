<h2>Computes the minimum and maximum money pump index</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The nonparametric GARP test is "sharp" in nature. This means that the test will only tell us whether the observed data
set is consistent with GARP. However, when the data set fails, it is often useful to know how close the observed behavior is to
satisfying the rationality restrictions (see Varian (1990) for an extensive motivation). Over the years, several measures (called
goodness-of-fit indices) have been introduced to evaluate the degree to which the observed data set is consistent with the
rationality axiom. Echenique et al. (2011) proposed the money pump index (MPI) as a measure of the severity of a GARP violation.
The MPI is defined as the amount of money that an arbitrageur can pump from the consumer. The higher is
the MPI value, the more severe is the violation of rationality. While the MPI measure is conceptually appealing, it may
be computationally challenging to determine this index for data sets with a large number of observations. In particular,
Smeulders et al. (2013) showed that computing the mean and median MPI is an NP-hard problem. As easy-to-apply
alternatives, they proposed the minimum and maximum MPI which can be computed efficiently (in polynomial time).
This function implements the algorithm provided by these authors to measure the minimum and maximum MPI values for the
given data set.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mpi(p, q)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code class="reqn">T X N</code> matrix of observed prices where each row corresponds to an observation and each column
corresponds to a consumption category. <code class="reqn">T</code> is the number of observations and <code class="reqn">N</code> is the number of consumption
categories.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>q</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code class="reqn">T X N</code> matrix of observed quantities where each row corresponds to an observation and each column
corresponds to a consumption category.<code class="reqn">T</code> is the number of observations and <code class="reqn">N</code> is the number of consumption
categories.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns two elements. The first element (<code>minimum_MPI</code>) is the minimum MPI and the second
element (<code>maximum_MPI</code>) is the maximum MPI.
