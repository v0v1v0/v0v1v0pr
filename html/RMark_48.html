<h2>Killdeer nest survival example data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set on killdeer that accompanies MARK as an example analysis for the
nest survival model.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 18 observations on the following 6 variables.
</p>
 <dl>
<dt>id</dt>
<dd>
<p>a MARK comment field with a nest id</p>
</dd>
<dt>FirstFound</dt>
<dd>
<p>the day the nest was first found</p>
</dd> <dt>LastPresent</dt>
<dd>
<p>the
last day that chicks were present</p>
</dd> <dt>LastChecked</dt>
<dd>
<p>the last day the nest
was checked</p>
</dd> <dt>Fate</dt>
<dd>
<p>the fate of the nest; 0=hatch and 1 depredated</p>
</dd>
<dt>Freq</dt>
<dd>
<p>the frequency of nests with this data; usually 1</p>
</dd> </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is a data set that accompanies program MARK as an example for nest
survival. The data structure for the nest survival model is completely
different from the capture history structure used for most MARK models.  To
cope with these data you must import them into a dataframe using R commands
and assign the specific variable names shown above. The id and Freq fields
are optional.  Freq is assumed to be 1 if not given.  You cannot import the
MARK .inp file structure directly into R without some manipulation.  Also
note that <code>import.chdata</code> and <code>convert.inp</code> do NOT
work for nest survival data. In the examples section below, the first
section of code provides an example of converting the killdeer.inp file into
a dataframe for RMark.
</p>
<p>If your dataframe contains a variable AgeDay1, which is the age of the nest
on the first occasion then you can use a variable called NestAge which will
create a set of time-dependent covariates named NestAge1,NestAge2
...NestAge(nocc-1) which will provide a way to incorporate the age of the
nest in the model.  This was added because the age covariate in the design
data for S assumes all nests are the same age and is not particularly
useful. This effect could be incorporated by using the add() function in the
design matrix but RMark does not have any capability for doing that and it
is easier to create a time-dependent covariate to do the same thing.

# This example is excluded from testing to reduce package check time
# EXAMPLE CODE FOR CONVERSION OF .INP TO NECESSARY DATA STRUCTURE
