<h2>Historical TWI Weights</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>See <a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/statistics/b13">https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/statistics/b13</a> for a full description.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The historical data is split across multiple files at source. We download
all of them and merge together into a single data frame, but note that
unlike with most of the other series available here it is not a simple
matter of rbind-ing all the data together. The composition of the TWI
changed in December 2014 but there were some components that were present
both before and after, for example Australia. These are returned as
separate fields in the output rather than combining them into a single
entry.
