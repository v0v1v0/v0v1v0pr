<h2>KitchenhamEtAl.CorrelationsAmongParticipants.Scanniello14JVLC data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data illustrate correlations between results from individual participants in a cross-over
experiment conducted by Scanniello and Erra:
[1] G. Scanniello and U. Erra, 'Distributed modeling of use case diagrams with a method based on think-pair-square: Results from two controlled experiments', Journal of Visual Languages and
Computing, vol. 25, no. 4, pp. 494–517, 2014.
The experiment investigated whether a new method based on think-pair-square and its
implementation in a integrated communication/modeling environment (TPS approach) is as effective
as traditional face-to-face (F2F approach) for requirements elicitation. The experiment was performed in two stages using different software systems.
