<h2>Reduce dimensionality of raster layers.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Reduce the number of layers by either performing a PCA on them or by eliminating highly correlated ones.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">raster.reduce(layers, method = "pca", n = NULL, thres = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>layers</code></td>
<td>
<p>Raster* object as defined by package raster.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either Principal Components Analysis ("pca", default) or Pearson's correlation ("cor").</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of layers to reduce to.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>thres</code></td>
<td>
<p>Value for pairwise Pearson's correlation above which one of the layers (randomly selected) is eliminated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Using a large number of explanatory variables in models with few records may lead to overfitting. This function allows to avoid it as much as possible.
If both n and thres are given, n has priority. If method is not recognized and layers come from raster.read function, only landcover is reduced by using only the dominating landuse of each cell.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A RasterStack object.
