<h2>rprev: Estimate disease point prevalence using a combination of registry data and
Monte Carlo simulations.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The rprev package uses available registry data to estimate point prevalence
at a specified index date. This is done by fitting two models to the registry
data: an incidence and a survival model. The first model is used to generate
an incident population with the survival model determining whether an individual
is alive at the index date and therefore contributing to prevalence.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Prevalence is estimated using incident cases from a set number of years,
where the larger this values the more accurate the prevalence estimates are.
However, if the user asks to use more years of incident cases than are
available in the registry data set, then the remaining years of incidence are
simulated.
</p>
<p>The primary function in this package is thereby <code>prevalence</code>,
which performs the combination of counted incidence from the registry data,
and the simulated cases, along with the calculation of their survival
probabilities at the index date.
</p>
<p><code>test_homogeneity</code> provides a summary of the incident cases in the
registry data set, allowing for inspection of whether the default
homogeneous Poisson process assumption holds for the disease in question.
