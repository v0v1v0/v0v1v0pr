<h2>3D visualization device system</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>3D real-time rendering system.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>RGL is a 3D real-time rendering system for R.
Multiple windows are managed at a time. Windows
may be divided into “subscenes”, where one has the current focus
that receives instructions from the R command-line. 
The device design is oriented towards the R device metaphor. If you send
scene management instructions, and there's no device open, it will be opened
automatically.
Opened devices automatically get the current device focus. The focus may be
changed by using <code>set3d()</code> or <code>useSubscene3d()</code>.
</p>
<p>RGL provides medium to high level functions for 3D interactive graphics, including
functions modelled on base graphics (<code>plot3d()</code>, etc.) as well as functions for 
constructing geometric objects (<code>cube3d()</code>, etc.).  Output
may be on screen using OpenGL, or to various standard 3D file formats including 
WebGL, PLY, OBJ, STL as well as 2D image formats, including PNG, Postscript, SVG, PGF.
</p>
<p>The <code>open3d()</code> function attempts to open a new RGL window,
using default settings specified by the user.
