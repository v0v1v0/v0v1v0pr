<h2>Annotation profiles of 116 gut prevalent species</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing the the KEGG orthology annotation profiles of 116 gut 
prevlent species which was downloaded from the Integrated Microbial Genomes 
(IMG).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with 116 elements and each elements represents the annotation
profile of the species</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This dataset focused on a list of 116 prevalent gut species, whose 
genome sequence is available in IMG database and sequence coverage is more 
than 1
annotation profiles of this 116 species was collected from IMG database.
</p>
<p>With a in-house R script, we obtained genomic data for all organisms from
the Department of Integrated Microbial Genomes project (IMG). For each
species, the list of genes mapped to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes orthologous groups (KEGG KOs) was downloaded. For more annotation 
information on these species, see <a href="img.jgi.doe.gov/">img.jgi.doe.gov/</a>.
