E-mails from DBWorld mailing list
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The dataset contains n= 64 bodies of e-mails in binary bag-of-words
representation which Filannino manually collected
from DBWorld mailing list.

DBWorld mailing list announces conferences, jobs, books, software and
grants.

Filannino applied supervised learning algorithm to classify e-mails
between “announces of conferences” and “everything else”.

Out of 64 e-mails, 29 are about conference announcements and 35 are not.
</p>
<p>Every e-mail is represented as a vector containing p binary values,
where p is the size of the vocabulary extracted from the entire
corpus with some constraints:
the common words such as “the”, “is” or “which”, so-called stop words, 
and words that have less than 3 characters or more than 30 chracters
are removed from the dataset. 

The entry of the vector is 1 if the corresponding word belongs to the
e-mail and 0 otherwise.


The number of unique words in the dataset is p=4702.

The dataset is originally from the UCI Machine Learning
Repository DBWorldData.
</p>
<p><code>rawDBWorld</code> is a list of 64 objects containing the original E-mails.
