<h2>Compute double observer probability of detection (No external covariates allowed)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Estimates the probability of detection in a two-observer system when observations are independent.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">F.double.obs.prob(df, observer = "both")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing the components <code>$obsby.1</code> and <code>$obsby.2</code>.
These components are either 0/1 (0 = missed, 1 = seen) or TRUE/FALSE (logical) vectors indicating whether
observer 1 (<code>obsby.1</code>) or observer 2 (<code>obsby.2</code>) spotted the target. There is 
no flexibility 
on naming these columns of <code>df</code>.  They must be named <code>$obsby.1</code> and <code>$obsby.2</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>observer</code></td>
<td>
<p>A number of text string indicating the primary observer.  Primary observers can be 
observer 1, or observer 2, or "both".
If, for example, observer 2 was a data recorder and part-time observer, or if observer 2
was the pilot, set <code>observer</code> = 1.  This dictates which set of observations form the denominator
of the double observer system.  For example, if <code>observer</code> = 1, observations by observer 1 that were not seen
by observer 2 are ignored. The estimate in this case uses targets seen by both observers and
those seen by observer 2 but not observer 1. If observer = "both", the denominator is computed twice, once 
assuming observer 1 was the primary, once assuming observer 2 was the primary, and then computes 
the probability of one or more observers sighting a target.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When <code>observer</code> = "both", the observers are assumed to be independent. In this case the estimate 
of detection is 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">p = p_1 + p_2 - p_1p_2</code>
</p>
  
<p>where <code class="reqn">p_1</code> is the proportion of targets seen by observer 2 that were also seen by observer 1, 
<code class="reqn">p_2</code> is the proportion of targets seen by observer 1 that were also seen by observer 2.
This estimator is very close to unbiased when observers are actually independent.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>
