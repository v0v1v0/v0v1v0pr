<h2>Designing, random assigning and evaluating Randomized Control Trials</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>RCT provides three important group of functions:
a) functions for pre-processing the design of the RCT 
b) Functions for assigning treatment status and checking for balances 
c) Function for evaluating the impact of the RCT
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>RCT helps you focus on the statistics of the randomized control trials, 
rather than the heavy programming lifting. 
RCT helps you in the whole process of designing and evaluating a RCT. 
1. Clean and summarise the data in which you want to randomly assign treatment 
2. Decide the share of observations that will go to control group 
3. Decide which variables to use for strata building
4. Robust Random Assignment by strata/blocks
5 Impact evaluation of all y's and heterogeneities

<h3>RCT functions</h3>

<p>treatment_assign: Robust treatment assign by strata/blocks
</p>
<p>impact_eval: Automatized impact evaluation with heterogeneous treatment effects
</p>
<p>balance_table: Balance tables for any length of covariates
</p>
<p>balance_regression: LPM of treatment status against covariates with F-test
</p>
<p>tau_min: Computation of the minimum detectable effect between control &amp; treatment units
</p>
<p>tau_min_probability: Computation of the minimum detectable effect between control &amp; treatment units for dichotomous y-vars
</p>
<p>summary_statistics: Summary statistics of all numeric columns in your data
</p>
<p>ntile_label: Rank and divide observations in n groups, with label
</p>
