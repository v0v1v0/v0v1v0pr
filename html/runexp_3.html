<h2>Plots an object of S3 class "<code>chain</code>"</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Acts on a "<code>chain</code>" object output from the "<code>chain</code>" 
function.  Plots convergence of chain, expected score by state, and 
expected score by lead-off batter (if applicable).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'chain'
plot(x, type = 1:2, lead_off = 1, fast = FALSE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>object of class "<code>chain</code>"</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>denotes which type of plot to generate - 1, 2, 3, or any combination
of these.  See details for plot descriptions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lead_off</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer 1-9.  Denotes which lead-off batter to plot in type 1 
and type 2 plots.  Lead-off batters 2-9 are only available if <code>chain</code>
was calculated with <code>cycle = TRUE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fast</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating whether to plot additional fast player states in
type 1 and type 2 plots.</p>
</td>

<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>NA</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function generates three types of plots:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Type 1: Plots chain convergence.  Each line corresponds to the 
expected score from a specific initial base/out state as at-bats
are accumulated.  If the chain has reached convergence, each line 
should level off.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Type 2: Plots expected score by initial base/out state.  This 
plot can be used to compare different states (e.g. is it better to have
a runner on second and one out or a runner on first and no outs?).  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Type 3: Plots expected score for an inning based on lead-off batter.
Requires a <code>chain</code> object that was created with <code>cycle = TRUE</code>.
The average across all lead-off batters is the most holistic metric for 
comparing different lineups.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both type 1 and type 2 plots rely on the specification of a lead-off batter.
In states with runners on base and/or outs, the lead-off batter refers to the
first batter to come up to to the plate starting in that situation, not 
the first batter to start the inning.  The "true" lead-off batter at the 
start of the inning corresponds to the R0 (no runners) 0 out case.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>No return value, called to generate plots.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Expected score for single batter (termed "offensive potential")
chain1 &lt;- chain("B", wku_probs)
plot(chain1)

# Expected score without cycling
lineup &lt;- wku_probs$name[1:9]
chain2 &lt;- chain(lineup, wku_probs)
plot(chain2)

# Expected score with cycling
chain3 &lt;- chain(lineup, wku_probs, cycle = TRUE)
plot(chain3, type = 1:3)
        
</code></pre>
