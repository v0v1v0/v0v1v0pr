<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A nation-wide chain is curious as to whether it can predict whether a former customer will make a purchase at one of its stores in the next 30 days based on the customer's spending habits.  Some variables are known by the chain (e.g., <code>Visits</code>) and some are available to purchase from credit card companies (e.g., <code>PercentClose</code>).  Is purchasing additional information about the customer worth it?
