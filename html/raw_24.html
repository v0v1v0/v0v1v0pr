note by Werner and Modlin.

<p><strong>Rate change</strong>
</p>
<p>This is a data frame with 7 observations of 5 variables.

</li>
<li>
<p> RateChange: A number indicating the rate change. Note that this is NOT done as a percent, i.e. .05 = 5
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> RateLevelIndex: This is one plus the rate change.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> CumulativeRateLevel: This is the cumulative product of the RateLevelIndex. Note that this varies slightly from the figures shown
in the study note. I believe this is due to rounding in the study note.
