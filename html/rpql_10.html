<h2>Joint effects selection in GLMMs using regularized PQL.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>rpql</code> offers fast joint selection of fixed and random effects in Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMMs) via regularization. The penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) is used as a loss function, and penalties are added on to perform fixed and random effects selection. This method of joint selection in GLMMs, referred to regularized PQL, is fast compared to information criterion and hypothesis testing (Hui et al., 2016). 
</p>
<p>Please note <code>rpql</code> is the core workshops function that performed regularized PQL on a single set of tuning parameters. <code>rpqlseq</code> is a wrapper to permit a sequence of tuning parameter values. The latter is often what users want to use.
</p>

The two elements in the list are as follows: for fixed effects, <code>pen.type$fixed</code> should be a vector with length equal to the number of columns in <code>X</code>. For random effects, <code>pen.weights$ran</code> should be a list of the same length as the list <code>Z</code>, where each element in that list is a vector with length equal to the number of columns in the corresponding element of the list <code>Z</code> (recall that each element of <code>Z</code> is a model matrix).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><b>Intro</b>
</p>
<p>Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) are an extension of Generalized Linear Models (GLM, see the <code>glm</code> function) to include one or more sets of random effects. For <code class="reqn">i = 1,\ldots,n</code>, where <code class="reqn">n</code> is the length of <code>y</code>, we have 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">g(\mu_{i}) = \bm{x}^T_i \bm{\beta} + \bm{z}^T_{i1} \bm{b}_{i1} + \bm{z}^T_{i2} \bm{b}_{i2} + \ldots,</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">g(\cdot)</code> is the link function, <code class="reqn">\mu_i</code> is the mean of the distribution for observation <code class="reqn">i</code>, <code class="reqn">\bm{x}_i</code> is row <code class="reqn">i</code> of the fixed effects model matrix <code>X</code>, and <code class="reqn">\bm{\beta}</code> is the fixed effects coefficients. For the random effects, <code class="reqn">\bm{z}_{i1}</code> is row <code class="reqn">i</code> of the random effects model matrix in the first element of <code>Z</code>, <code class="reqn">\bm{z}_{i2}</code> is from the second element of <code>Z</code> and so forth. The random effects <code class="reqn">\bm{b}_{i1}</code>, <code class="reqn">\bm{b}_{i2}, \ldots</code> are drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with mean zero and differing covariance matrices <code class="reqn">\bm{D}_1, \bm{D}_2, \ldots</code>.
</p>
<p>Note that having lists for <code>id, Z</code>, allows for multiple sets of random effects to be included in the GLMM. This is analogous to the <code>lme4</code> package, where multiple random effects are permitted in the formula e.g., <code>(1|creek) + (1|creek:sample)</code>. If the GLMM contains only one set of random effects, e.g., in longitudinal data, then the two lists will all contain only one element. Cases where multiple sets of random effects may be used include nested and crossed designs, in which case <code>id, Z</code>, will have two or more elements. It is recommended that the user think through and design these lists carefully to ensure that they are actually constructing the appropriate GLMM of interest. Yes it takes some getting use too, and we apologize for this =( Please see examples below for some ideas.
</p>

<p><b>Regularized PQL</b>
</p>
<p>Regularized PQL is designed as a fast approach to joint selection to GLMMs (Hui et al., 2016). It works by taking the penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL, Breslow and Clayton, 1993) and adding on penalties to perform selection of the fixed and random effects. That is, maximize the regularized PQL function
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\ell = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \log(f(y_i | \bm{\beta}, \bm{b}_{i1}, \bm{b}_{i2}, \ldots)) - \frac{1}{2} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \bm{b}^T_{i1}\bm{D}^{-1}_1 \bm{b}_{i1} - \frac{1}{2} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \bm{b}^T_{i2}\bm{D}^{-1}_2 \bm{b}_{i2} - \ldots - P_{\lambda}</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">P_{\lambda}</code> denotes penalties to shrink the fixed effect <code class="reqn">\bm{\beta}</code> and random effect <code class="reqn">\bm{b}_{i1}</code>, <code class="reqn">\bm{b}_{i2}, \ldots</code> coefficients, which depend on one or more tuning parameters <code class="reqn">\lambda</code>. Like the PQL itself, regularized PQL is a fast approach for estimating GLMMs because it treats the random effects as "fixed" coefficients, and therefore no integration is required. Penalties are then used to shrunk one or more <code class="reqn">\bm{\beta}</code>'s and <code class="reqn">\bm{b}</code>'s to zero, the latter done so in a group-based manner, in order to perform joint selection (see Hui et al., 2016, for details). In short, regularized PQL is able to fit many GLMMs in a relatively short period of time, which in turn facilitates the construction of a solution or regularization path ranging from the null (intercept-only) to the full (saturated) model. A tuning parameter selection method such as information criterion can then be used to pick the select the final subset of fixed and random effects. A few penalty types are available in the package, from which we prefer to use the adaptive LASSO (with weights based on the full model, Zou, 2006) mainly because by having weights, we can avoids have to search through a two-dimensional grid of tuning parameter values.
</p>
<p>Note that if one only wanted to penalize the fixed effects and leave the random effects unpenalized, this can be achieved by setting the second element/s of lambda equal to to e.g., <code>lambda = c(1,0)</code>. Note though that in longitudinal studies, for covariates included as both fixed and random effects, if the random effects is not penalized then neither should the fixed effect. This ensures that no covariates end up being selected in the model as a purely random effects (non-hierarchical shrinkage, Hui et al., 2016). This can be accounted for also setting the corresponding elements of <code>pen.weights$fixed</code> to zero.
</p>
<p><b>AN IMPORTANT NOTE</b> 
</p>
<p>While regularized PQL is relatively fast, it will produce biased estimates of the fixed and random effects parameters for non-normal responses, especially if the amount of data to estimate each random effect is not large e.g., if the number of time points or cluster size is not large. We envision regularized PQL as a method of joint variable selection ONLY, and strongly encourage the user to adopt a hybrid estimation approach (using <code>hybrid.est = TRUE</code>, for instance). That is, once model selection is performed using regularized PQL, the final submodel should be re-estimated using more exact methods like quadrature or MCMC.
</p>
<p>Because regularized PQL treats the random effects as “fixed" coefficients and therefore penalizes these, then the random effects covariance matrices <code class="reqn">\bm{D}_1, \bm{D}_2, \ldots</code> are regarded more as nuisance parameters. This is in contrast to traditional maximum likelihood estimation where the random effect coefficients <code class="reqn">\bm{b}_{i1}</code>, <code class="reqn">\bm{b}_{i2}, \ldots</code> are integrated over. As nuisance parameters, regularized PQL employs an iterative estimator based on maximizing the Laplace-approximated marginal log-likelihood, assuming all other parameters are fixed, for estimating the covariance matrix <code class="reqn">\bm{D}_1, \bm{D}_2, \ldots</code>. This iterative estimator was used in Hui et al., (2016) for independent clustered data specifically. When they are multiple sets of random effects, each covariance matrix is estimated conditionally on all others i.e., the random effect coefficients corresponding to all other random effects are held constant. This can be thought of as employing a series of conditional Laplace approximations to obtain updates for <code class="reqn">\bm{D}_1, \bm{D}_2, \ldots</code>.
</p>



<p><b>A not so short discussion about information criterion</b>
</p>
<p>How to choose the tuning parameters for penalized regression is an active area of area of research in statistics (see for instance Zhang et al., 2010, Hui et al., 2014), with the most popular solutions being cross validation and information criteria. That is, a solution path is constructed and the best submodel is then chosen by minimizing the value of the information criterion. Anyway, <code>rpql</code> offers the following information criteria for tuning parameter selection, as available in <code>ics</code> in the output. Please note all of the criteria below use only the first part of the PQL function as the loss function i.e., <code class="reqn">IC = -2\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \log(f(y_i | \bm{\beta}, \bm{b}_{i1}, \bm{b}_{i2}, \ldots)) +</code> model complexity terms. 
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> A AIC-type criterion that penalizes a values of 2 for every non-zero fixed effect coefficient, and, for each set of random effects, penalizes a value of 2 for every non-zero random effect coefficient in that set.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A BIC-type criterion that penalizes a value of <code class="reqn">\log(n)</code> for every non-zero fixed effect coefficient, and, for each set of random effects, penalizes a value of <code class="reqn">\log(n_c)</code> for every non-zero, unique element in covariance matrix for that set, where <code>n_c</code> denotes the number of clusters corresponding to that random effect.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A BIC-type criterion that penalizes a value of <code class="reqn">\log(n)</code> for every non-zero fixed effect coefficient, and, for each set of random effects, penalizes a value of <code class="reqn">\log(n)</code> for every non-zero, unique element in covariance matrix for that set. This combination of penalties is the one used in the package <code>lme4</code>. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Three hybrid information criteria that penalizes a value <code class="reqn">\log(n)</code> for every non-zero fixed effect coefficient, and, for each set of random effects, penalizes a value of 2/1/0.5 for every non-zero random effect coefficient in that set.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Selection consistency for all but the first AIC criteria have been established, although empirically performance may differ. We generally prefer the three hybrid criterion, although it is recommended that the user tries several of them and see how results differ!

<h3>Warnings</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> We strongly recommend you scale your responses (if normally distributed) and any continuous covariates, otherwise <code>rpql</code> like all penalized likelihood methods, may not make much sense!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Like its standard unpenalized counterpart, regularized PQL can produce very bias parameter estimates in finite samples, especially if you do not have a lot of data to estimate each random effect. We therefore envision regularized PQL as a tool for fast model selection in GLMMs, and strongly recommend you re-estimate the final submodel using more accurate estimation methods i.e., use a hybrid estimation approach, in order to obtain better final parameter estimates and predictions of the random effects.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If <code>save.data = TRUE</code>, the data you fitted the GLMM is also saved as part of the output, and this can potentially take up a lot of memory. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If you are constantly suffering convergence issues with regularized PQL, even after multiple restarts, consider increasing <code>lambda[2]</code> to penalized the random effects more and stabilize the estimation algorithm. You may also want to consider better starting values, in particular, smaller values of <code>start$ranef</code>. Good luck!
