<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Get quick pre-computed counts of a limited number of dimensions.
</p>
<p><code>occ_count_country()</code> will return a data.frame with occurrence counts by
country. By using <code>occ_count_country(publishingCountry="DK")</code> will
return the occurrence contributions Denmark has made to each country.
</p>
<p><code>occ_count_pub_country()</code> will return a data.frame with occurrence counts by
publishing country. Using <code>occ_count_pub_country(country="DK")</code>, will return
the occurrence contributions each country has made to that focal <code>country=DK</code>.
</p>
<p><code>occ_count_year()</code> will return a data.frame with the total occurrences
mediated by GBIF for each year. By using <code>occ_counts_year(year="1800,1900")</code>
will only return counts for that range.
</p>
<p><code>occ_count_basis_of_record()</code> will return a data.frame with total occurrences
mediated by GBIF for each basis of record.
</p>
