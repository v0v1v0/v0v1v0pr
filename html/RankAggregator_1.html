<h2>RankAggregator</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides a set of functions to easily compute an aggregate
ranking (also called a median ranking or a
compromise ranking) according to the axiomatic approach presented
by Cook et al. (2007). This approach minimises the number of violations
between all candidate consensus rankings and all input (partial) rankings,
and draws on a branch and bound algorithm, and a heuristic algorithm to
drastically improve speed. Input rankings can be either incomplete (partial)
or complete.
<br><br> The package also provides an option to bootstrap
resulting consensus ranking based on resampling input rankings (with
replacement). This approach was inspired by Marshall et al. (1998).
