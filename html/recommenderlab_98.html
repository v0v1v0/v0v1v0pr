<h2>
Create a Hybrid Recommender
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates and combines recommendations using several recommender algorithms.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">HybridRecommender(..., weights = NULL, aggregation_type = "sum")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p> objects of class 'Recommender'. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p> weights for the recommenders. The recommenders are equally
weighted by default. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>aggregation_type</code></td>
<td>
<p> How are the recommendations aggregated. Options are "sum", "min", and
"max". </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The hybrid recommender is initialized with a set of pretrained Recommender objects.
Typically, the algorithms are trained using the same training set. If different
training sets are used, then, at least the training sets
need to have the same items in the same order.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, hybrid recommenders can be created using the regular <code>Recommender()</code>
interface. Here <code>method</code> is set to <code>HYBRID</code> and <code>parameter</code> contains
a list with recommenders and weights. recommenders are a list of recommender alorithms,
where each algorithms is represented as a list with elements name (method of the recommender)
and parameters (the algorithms parameters). This method can be used in <code>evaluate()</code>
</p>
<p>For creating recommendations (<code>predict</code>), each recommender algorithm
is used to create ratings. The individual ratings are combined using
a weighted sum where missing ratings are ignored. Weights can be specified in <code>weights</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class 'Recommender'.
