<h2>robust2sls: A package for outlier robust 2SLS inference and testing</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The robust2sls package provides two main functionalities. First, it
implements an algorithm for determining whether an observations is an outlier
based on its standardized residual and re-estimation based on the sub-sample
excluding all outliers. This procedure is often used in empirical research to
show that the results are not driven by outliers. This package has
implemented the algorithm in various forms and the user can select between
different initial estimators and how often the algorithm is iterated. The
statistical inference is adapted to account for potential false positives
(classifying observations as outliers even though they are not).
</p>
<p>Second, the robust2sls package provides easy-to-use statistical tests on
whether the difference between the original and the outlier-robust estimates
is statistically significant. Furthermore, several different statistical
tests are implemented to test whether the sample actually contains outliers.
