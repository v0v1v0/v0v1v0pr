<h2>Get the common root/stem of words</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function computes the stems of each of the
given words in the vector.
This reduces a word to its base component,
making it easier to compare words
like win, winning, winner.
See <a href="http://snowball.tartarus.org/">http://snowball.tartarus.org/</a> for
more information about the concept and algorithms
for stemming.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">wordStem(words, language = character(), warnTested = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>words</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector of words whose stems are to be
computed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>language</code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of a recognized language for the package.
This should either be a single string which is an element in the
vector  returned by <code>getStemLanguages</code>, or
alternatively a character vector of length 3
giving the names of the routines for
creating and closing a Snowball <code>SN\_env</code> environment
and performing the stem (in that order).
See the example below.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>warnTested</code></td>
<td>
<p>an option to control whether a warning is issued
about languages which have not been explicitly tested as part of the
unit testing of the code.  For the most part, one can ignore these
warnings and so they are turned off. In the future, we might
consider controlling this with a global option, but for now
we suppress the warnings by default.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This uses Dr. Martin Porter's stemming algorithm
and the interface generated by  Snowball
<a href="http://snowball.tartarus.org/">http://snowball.tartarus.org/</a>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A character vector with as many elements
as there are in the input vector
with the corresponding elements being the
stem of the  word.
