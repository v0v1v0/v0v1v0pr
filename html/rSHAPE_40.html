<h2>This is the function that runs the main body, or meaningful execution, of SHAPE experiments.
In other words this is the main work-horse function that calls all the other parts and will
execute you simulation run.  It has the main parts of:
1. Stochastic Events;
2. Deaths;
3. Births;
4. Mutations;
and during mutations this is where the mutational landscape is queried and updated as required.
NOTE: Many of its internal operations are controlled by options with the suffix "shape_" and are
not explicitly passed as arguments at call to this function.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is the function that runs the main body, or meaningful execution, of SHAPE experiments.
In other words this is the main work-horse function that calls all the other parts and will
execute you simulation run.  It has the main parts of:
1. Stochastic Events;
2. Deaths;
3. Births;
4. Mutations;
and during mutations this is where the mutational landscape is queried and updated as required.
NOTE: Many of its internal operations are controlled by options with the suffix "shape_" and are
not explicitly passed as arguments at call to this function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">runReplicate(func_inputFrames, func_currStep, func_stepCounter,
  func_growthModel = getOption("shape_const_growthForm"),
  func_growthRate = getOption("shape_const_growthRate"),
  func_landscapeModel = getOption("shape_simModel"),
  func_fileName_dataBase = getOption("shape_fileName_dataBase"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func_inputFrames</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is a list of data.frames, either 1 or 2 elements, reporting on the last
one or two steps in the simulation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func_currStep</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is an integer value counting the absolute step in the simulation, its value is never reset.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func_stepCounter</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is an integer value which is a counter in the most tradititional sense.
It's job is to track if it's time for a Stochastic event to trigger and its value is reset at that point.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func_growthModel</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the growth model of the SHAPE run, it is passed here as a computational
convenience since it is used numerous times in the function</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func_growthRate</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the growth rate of the SHAPE run, it is passed here as a computational
convenience since it is used numerous times in the function</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func_landscapeModel</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the fitness landscape model of the SHAPE run, it is passed here as a computational
convenience since it is used numerous times in the function</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func_fileName_dataBase</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the filepaths of DBs of the SHAPE run, it is passed here as a computational
convenience since it is used numerous times in the function</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a new list of 2 data.frames reporting on the state of SHAPE community for the last 2 time steps -
ie: the one just run, and the most prior step.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>There is no example as this cannot work outisde of a runSHAPE call, it requires data produced by the simulation experiment.
