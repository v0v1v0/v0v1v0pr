<h2>Names and numbers of symbols bound in an environment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>env_names()</code> returns object names from an enviroment <code>env</code> as a
character vector. All names are returned, even those starting with
a dot. <code>env_length()</code> returns the number of bindings.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">env_names(env)

env_length(env)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>env</code></td>
<td>
<p>An environment.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A character vector of object names.
</p>


<h3>Names of symbols and objects</h3>

<p>Technically, objects are bound to symbols rather than strings,
since the R interpreter evaluates symbols (see <code>is_expression()</code> for a
discussion of symbolic objects versus literal objects). However it
is often more convenient to work with strings. In rlang
terminology, the string corresponding to a symbol is called the
<em>name</em> of the symbol (or by extension the name of an object bound
to a symbol).
</p>


<h3>Encoding</h3>

<p>There are deep encoding issues when you convert a string to symbol
and vice versa. Symbols are <em>always</em> in the native encoding. If
that encoding (let's say latin1) cannot support some characters,
these characters are serialised to ASCII. That's why you sometimes
see strings looking like <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠&lt;U+1234&gt;⁠</code>, especially if you're running
Windows (as R doesn't support UTF-8 as native encoding on that
platform).
</p>
<p>To alleviate some of the encoding pain, <code>env_names()</code> always
returns a UTF-8 character vector (which is fine even on Windows)
with ASCII unicode points translated back to UTF-8.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">env &lt;- env(a = 1, b = 2)
env_names(env)
</code></pre>
