<h2>Process Raster Results</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function processes the results of a list of calculations, packaging them into SpatRaster objects and naming them appropriately.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">process_raster_result(out, x, alpha, window)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>out</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list containing the results of calculations that need to be transformed into SpatRaster objects. Each element in the list corresponds to a different calculation result.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of SpatRaster objects or a similar object used as a template for creating new SpatRaster objects. Specifically, 'x[[1]]' is used as the template.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric or numeric vector indicating the weight(s) used in the distance calculations that generated 'out'. It is used to label the results appropriately.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>window</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric or numeric vector indicating the size(s) of the moving window(s) used in the calculations that generated 'out'. It is used to label the results.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function is designed to post-process the results of spatial calculations performed on raster data. The typical use case is to process results from a function that performs calculations on different 'windows' of the data, using varying 'alpha' parameters, and returns the results as a list. This function takes that list, converts each element to a SpatRaster (using the first SpatRaster in 'x' as a template), and assigns appropriate names to each based on the 'alpha' and 'window' parameters.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of SpatRaster objects corresponding to the different processed results. Each SpatRaster is named based on the 'alpha' and 'window' parameters used in the calculation. The naming convention is 'alpha.&lt;alpha value&gt;' for the inner lists and 'window.&lt;window size&gt;' for the outer list.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 

# Assume 'result_list' is obtained from a previous calculation, containing
# multiple results to be converted to SpatRaster objects.
# 'raster_template' is a list of SpatRaster objects used as templates.

processed_results &lt;- process_raster_result(out = result_list, 
                                           x = raster_template, 
                                           alpha = c(1, 2), 
                                           window = c(3, 5))
