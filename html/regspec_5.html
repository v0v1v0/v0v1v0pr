<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>spec.true</code> is a matrix of coordinates for the spectral density of the
ARMA(3,1) model with AR and MA coefficients (-0.5, 0.4, 0.8) and (0.2)
respectively. This was the model used to simulate the example data sets
<code>Dfexample</code>, <code>Dpexample2</code> and <code>Dpexample3</code>,
which consist of observations of the process at every time point,
at every second time point and every third time point, respectively.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>See the package <code>TSA</code> for functions to calculate values of the spectral density for different ARMA models, and the function <code>arima.sim</code> for simulating time series from them.
