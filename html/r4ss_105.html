<h2>Calculate new tunings for length and age compositions and (re)run models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a table of values that can be copied into the SS control file
for SS 3.30 models to adjust the input sample sizes for length and age
compositions based on either the Francis or McAllister-Ianelli tuning or
adds the Dirichlet-Multinomial parameters to the necessary files to
tune the model using an integrated method.
Optionally, this function can automatically add these tunings to the
appropriate files and rerun the model for the desired number of iterations.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SS_tune_comps(
  replist = NULL,
  fleets = "all",
  option = c("Francis", "MI", "none", "DM"),
  digits = 6,
  write = TRUE,
  niters_tuning = 0,
  init_run = FALSE,
  dir = getwd(),
  model = "ss",
  exe_in_path = FALSE,
  extras = "-nox",
  allow_up_tuning = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>replist</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list object created by <code>SS_output()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fleets</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either the string 'all', or a vector of fleet numbers</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>option</code></td>
<td>
<p>Which type of tuning: 'none', 'Francis', 'MI', or 'DM'.
The first option, <code>none</code>, will only return information about the
Francis and MI weights that are suggested.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>digits</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of digits to round numbers to.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>write</code></td>
<td>
<p>Write suggested tunings to a file saved to the disk called
<code>suggested_tunings.ss</code>. This file name is currently hard coded and will
be saved in <code>dir</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>niters_tuning</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of times to retune models. Defaults to 0,
where only the tunings should be calculated and the model is not rerun. Note
that for DM, it will be assumed that 0 means not to run the model and
specifying 1 or greater will only run the model once (because DM is not an
iterative retuning method).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>init_run</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should the model be run before calculating the tunings?
Defaults to <code>FALSE</code>. This run is not counted as an iteration for
<code>niters_tuning</code> and will not be used if <code>option = "DM"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dir</code></td>
<td>
<p>The path to the model directory.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the stock synthesis executable. This model is
assumed to be either in the same folder as the model files (specified in
<code>dir</code>), or in the PATH if <code>exe_in_path = TRUE</code>. This will not be used if
<code>init_run = FALSE</code> and <code>niters_tuning = 0</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>exe_in_path</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. If TRUE, will look for exe in the PATH. If FALSE,
will look for exe in the model folders. Default = FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>extras</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional commands to use when running SS. Default = "-nox"
will reduce the amount of command-line output. A commonly used option is
"-nohess" to skip calculating the hessian (and asymptotic uncertainty).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>allow_up_tuning</code></td>
<td>
<p>Allow tuning values for Francis or MI &gt; 1? Defaults to
FALSE, which caps tuning values at 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value specifying if output should be printed
to the screen.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional arguments to pass to run_SS_models.</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a table that can be copied into the control file.
If <code>write=TRUE</code> then will write the values to a file
(currently hardwired to go in the directory where the model was run
and called "suggested_tunings.ss").
</p>


<h3><code>option</code></h3>



<h4>Francis</h4>

<p>The Francis approach to data weighting adjusts the input sample sizes using
a scalar such that the fit of the expected value is within the uncertainty
intervals based on the expected fit given adjusted sample sizes.
</p>



<h4>McAllister-Ianelli (MI)</h4>

<p>Also known as the Harmonic-Mean approach to data weighting, the
McAllister-Ianelli weighting approach uses a scalar to adjust the input
sample size of composition data based matching the arithmetic mean
of the input sample size to the harmonic mean of the effective sample size.
</p>



<h4>Dirichlet-Multinomial (DM)</h4>

<p>The Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood is an alternative approach that allows
the tuning factor to be estimated rather than iteratively tuned.
Note that for <code>option = "DM"</code> a table of tunings is
not created as the DM is not an iterative reweighting option. Instead, each
of the fleets with length- and age-composition data will be assigned a DM
parameter and the model will be rerun.
</p>



<h3>SS versions</h3>



<h4>3.30.00-3.30.11</h4>

<p>Recommended_var_adj and other columns were named differently in these
early version of SS. Calculations are thus done internally based on
finding the correct column name.
</p>



<h4>3.30.12-3.30.16</h4>

<p>Starting with SS version 3.30.12, the "Length_Comp_Fit_Summary"
table in Report.sso is already in the format required to paste into
the control file to apply the McAllister-Ianelli tuning. However, this
function provides the additional option of the Francis tuning and the
ability to compare the two approaches, as well as the functionality to add
tunings and rerun the model. The "Age_Comp_Fit_Summary" table in Report.sso
is formatted similarly though, though the Recommended_var_adj was wrongly
set to 1 for all fleets in SS versions 3.30.12 to 3.30.16. Thus, the
MI approach is not taken from this recommended column, instead, it is
calculated from the harmonic mean and input sample sizes.
