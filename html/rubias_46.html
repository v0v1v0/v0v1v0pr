<h2>rubias: Bayesian inference from the conditional genetic stock identification model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Read the "rubias-overview" vignette for information on data input formats
and how to use the package
</p>


<h3>the <code>rubias</code> main high-level functions</h3>

<p>The following functions are wrappers, designed for user-friendly input and useful output:
</p>
<p><code>infer_mixture</code> is used to perform genetic stock identification.
Options include standard MCMC and the parametric bootstrap bias correction.
</p>
<p><code>self_assign</code> does simple self-assignment of individuals in a reference data set
to the various collections in the reference data set.
</p>
<p><code>assess_reference_loo</code> does leave-one-out based simulations to predict how
accurately GSI can be done.
</p>
<p><code>assess_reference_mc</code> uses Monte-Carlo cross-validation based simulations
to predict how accurately GSI can be done.
</p>
<p><code>assess_pb_bias_correction</code> attempts to demonstrate how much (or little)
improvement can be expected from the parametric bootstrap correction given a particular
reference data set.
</p>


<h3>genetic data format</h3>

<p>See the vignette.
</p>


<h3>example data</h3>

<p><code>alewife</code>, <code>blueback</code>, and <code>chinook</code> are
genetic data sets that are useful for playing around with rubias and testing it
out.
