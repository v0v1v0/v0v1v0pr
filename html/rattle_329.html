<h2>Display the Rattle User Interface</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Rattle user interface uses the RGtk2 package to present an
intuitive point and click interface for data mining, extensively
building on the excellent collection of R packages by very many
authors for data manipulation, exploration, analysis, and evaluation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rattle(csvname=NULL, dataset=NULL, useGtkBuilder=TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>csvname</code></td>
<td>
<p>the optional name of a CSV file to load into Rattle on
startup.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dataset</code></td>
<td>
<p>The optional name as a character string of a dataset to
load into Rattle on startup.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>useGtkBuilder</code></td>
<td>
<p>if not supplied then automatically determine whether to
use the new GtkBuilder rather than the deprecated libglade. A user
can override the heuristic choice with TRUE or FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Refer to the Rattle home page in the URL below for a growing reference
manual for using Rattle.
</p>
<p>Whilst the underlying functionality of Rattle is built upon a vast
collection of other R packages, Rattle itself provides a collection of
utility functions used within Rattle. These are made available through
loading the rattle package into your R library. The See Also section
lists these utility functions that may be useful outside of Rattle.
</p>
<p>Rattle can initialise some options using a .Rattle file if the folder
in which Rattle is started. The currently supported options are
.RATTLE.DATA, .RATTLE.SCORE.IN, and .RATTLE.SCORE.OUT.
</p>
<p>If the environment variable RATTLE\_DATA is defined then that is set
as the default CSV file name to load. Otherwise, if .RATTLE.DATA is
defined then that will be used as the CSV file to load. Otherwise, if
csvname is provided then that will be used.
</p>
<p>Two environments are exported by Rattle, capturing the current rattle
state (crs) and the current rattle variables (crv).
