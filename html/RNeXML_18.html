<h2>Finds the method that callNextMethod() should chain to</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Attempts to find the "next" method in the inheritance chain. This would
(ideally) be the method that <code>methods::callNextMethod()</code> would chain to,
as a result of the method <code>methods::addNextMethod()</code> would find (and return
in the <code>nextMethod</code> slot of the <code>MethodWithNext</code>
object). Hence, in theory one shouldn't ever need this, but unfortunately
<code>addNextMethod()</code> is broken (and errors out) if one of the classes in the
signature name-clashes with an S4 class defined in another package that is
loaded.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">findNextMethod(method, f = NULL, envir = topenv())
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>MethodDefinition</code>, the method for which to find
the next method</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>f</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>standardGeneric</code>, the standard generic for which to find
the next method. By default this will be obtained from <code>method</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>envir</code></td>
<td>
<p>the environment in which to find the method</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The next method will be determined by the S4 inheritance chain. However,
this function will walk only the inheritance chain of those arguments in
the signature that are defined in the package of the generic method from
which this function was invoked (directly or indirectly). If there are
no such parameters in the signature, or if there is more than one,
finding the next method is handed off to <code>methods::addNextMethod()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a <code>MethodDefinition</code> object that is the next method in the
chain by inheritance
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>In theory a class name clash between packages shouldn't be a problem
because class names can be namespaced, and the <code>MethodDefinition</code>
object passed to <code>addNextMethod()</code> has all the necessary namespace
information. Hopefully, at some point this gets fixed in R, and then we
don't need this anymore.
