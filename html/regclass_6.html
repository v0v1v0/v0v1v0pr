<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Students were asked to rate on a scale of 1 (very unattractive) to 5 (very attractive) the attractiveness of 70 college-aged women who had posted their photos on a dating website.  Of the nearly 100 respondents, most were straight males.  <code>Score</code> represents the average of these ratings.
</p>
<p>In a separate survey, students (of both genders) were asked to rate characteristics of the woman by answering the questions:  what is her race, is she displaying her cleavage prominently, is she a lesbian, is she physically fit, etc.  The variables ending â€œScore" represent the number of students who answered Yes to the question.  Other variables (such as <code>Selfie</code>, <code>Smile</code>) represent the consensus among the students.  The only attribute taken from the woman's profile was <code>Actual.Sexuality</code>.
