<h2>Detect RStudio Jobs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Use this function to detect whether RStudio is running an R "job".
These jobs are normally used for actions taken in the Jobs tab, as well
as within the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> build pane.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">isJob()

isBackgroundJob()

isWorkbenchJob()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>isWorkbenchJob()</code> is used to detect scripts which have been launched as
Workbench jobs, and is only available in RStudio Workbench 2024.04 or newer.
These jobs use the RStudio Launcher to run <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> scripts on remote clusters, as
opposed to <code>isBackgroundJob()</code>, which is used to detect background jobs
which are run on the local machine.
</p>
<p>This function is primarily intended to be used by package authors, who
need to customize the behavior of their methods when run within an
RStudio job.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Boolean; <code>TRUE</code> if this is an RStudio job.
</p>
