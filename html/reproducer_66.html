<h2>KitchenhamMadeyskiBrereton.ABBAReportedEffectSizes data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data is used in the paper: Barbara Kitchenham, Lech Madeyski and Pearl Brereton. Meta-analysis for Families of Experiments: A Systematic Review and Reproducibility Assessment, Empirical Software Engineering (2019) doi:10.1007/s10664-019-09747-0.
This file holds the individual effect sizes for the first time period (or equivalently the first document), as reported by the 3 primary studies in the systematic review that reported results for each document/time period separately.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A text file with variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Study</dt>
<dd>
<p>This field includes the study identifier of each of the 3 primary studies which were included in the systematic review. The studies are S3, S7 and S11.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Type</dt>
<dd>
<p>This identifies the type of effect size used by the study authors. d  or g refer to dIG and gIG.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>
<p>Always set to Rep. This identifies that the data was as reported by the primary study authors.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Design</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mixed means different experiments in a particular family used different methods (onlyS3 used mixed methods and 4 experiments used the 4 group crossover and one used an independent groups design). ABBACO is the standard 2-group crossover design. </p>
</dd>
<dt>Exp1</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the reported standardised effect size for the first time period and the first experiment in the family.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Exp2</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the reported standardised effect size for the first time period and second experiment in the family.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Exp3</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the reported standardised effect size for the first time period and the third experiment in the family.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Exp4</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the reported standardised effect size for the first time period and the fourth experiment in the family. NA means there was no fourth experiment in the family.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Exp5</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the reported standardised effect size for the first time period and the fifth experiment in the family. NA means there was no fifth experiment in the family.</p>
</dd>
