<h2>Hsu et al. (2009) Algorithm</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>It is an implementation of Hsu et al. algorithm to transform a digraph and a 
known set of forbidden paths, into a new graph that does not allow any forbidden path 
as part of its solutions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">modify_graph_hsu(g, f, cores = 1L)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>g</code></td>
<td>
<p>The digraph to be transformed, written as a data frame where each row represents a 
directed arc. The columns must be named <code>from</code> and <code>to</code>, and can be of any data
type. On each row no cells can be <code>NULL</code> or <code>NA</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>f</code></td>
<td>
<p>The set of forbidden paths, written as a data frame. Each row represents a path
as a sequence of nodes. Each row may be of different size, filling the empty cells with
<code>NA</code>. All nodes involved must be part of <code>g</code>, and no forbidden path can be of
size 2. This is because the latter is thought as an arc that should not exist in
the first place.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cores</code></td>
<td>
<p>This algorithm can be run using R's parallel processing functions. This
variable represents the number of processing cores you want to assign for the
transformation. The default value is one single core. 
It is suggested to not assign all of your available cores to the function.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This version of the algorithm produce smaller graphs, with less new nodes and arcs.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A new graph, generated following Hsu's backward construction, in which no path
includes one of the forbidden subpaths. The graph is returned in a data frame format,
where each row represents a directed arc, with or without additional attributes (if
corresponds). However, regardless of the data type of the original graph, nodes on the
new graph are of type character. The new nodes names are generated by incrementally
concatenating the nodes on a forbidden path, but split by a pipe character (<code>|</code>).
