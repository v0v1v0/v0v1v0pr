<h2>Change the representation of a rank</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>convertRank converts a rank from its ranking representation to its ordering representation, and vice-versa.
The function does not work with partial ranking. The transformation to convert a rank from ordering to ranking
representation is the same that from ranking to ordering representation, there is no need to precise the representation
of rank x.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">convertRank(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a rank (vector) datum either in its ranking or ordering representation.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The ranking representation r=(r_1,...,r_m) contains the ranks assigned to the objects,
and means that the ith object is in r_ith position.
</p>
<p>The ordering representation o=(o_1,...,o_m) means that object o_i is in the ith position.
</p>
<p>Let us consider the following example to illustrate both notations: a judge, which has to rank three holidays destinations
according to its preferences, O1 = Countryside, O2 =Mountain and O3 = Sea, ranks first Sea, second Countryside,
and last Mountain. The ordering result of the judge is o = (3, 1, 2) whereas the ranking result is r = (2, 3, 1).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a rank (vector) in its ordering representation if its ranking representation has been given in input of
convertRank, and vice-versa.
