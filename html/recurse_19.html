<h2>Calculates recursion information from the trajectory inside a polygon</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The number of  revisits to a polygon is calculated as the number of segments of the trajectory 
passing through the polygon.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'Move'
getRecursionsInPolygon(
  trajectory,
  polygon,
  threshold = 0,
  timeunits = c("hours", "secs", "mins", "days"),
  verbose = TRUE
)

getRecursionsInPolygon(
  trajectory,
  polygon,
  threshold = 0,
  timeunits = c("hours", "secs", "mins", "days"),
  verbose = TRUE
)

## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
getRecursionsInPolygon(
  trajectory,
  polygon,
  threshold = 0,
  timeunits = c("hours", "secs", "mins", "days"),
  verbose = TRUE
)

## S3 method for class 'move2'
getRecursionsInPolygon(
  trajectory,
  polygon,
  threshold = 0,
  timeunits = c("hours", "secs", "mins", "days"),
  verbose = TRUE
)

## S3 method for class 'MoveStack'
getRecursionsInPolygon(
  trajectory,
  polygon,
  threshold = 0,
  timeunits = c("hours", "secs", "mins", "days"),
  verbose = TRUE
)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The number of segments of the trajectory passing through the polygon is counted as 
the number of revisits. For each  revisit, the time spent inside the polygon is calculated, as 
well as the time since the last visit (NA for the first visit). In order to calculate the time values, 
the crossing time of the polygon is calculated by assuming linear movement at a constant speed between 
the points inside and outside the polygon. Note the polygon must be convex as described in further detail below.
</p>
<p><strong>Projection.</strong> Consider the projection used. Since segments are counted passing through the
polygon, an equal area projection would ensure similar size comparisons. 
A geographic projection is not appropriate. The projection for the 
polygon and the trajectory must be the same.
</p>
<p><strong>Polygon.</strong> The polygon must be specified as a st_polygon object. It should consist
of a single polygon (i.e. st_geometry_type = POLYGON). It should further be convex, though this
requirement is not enforced, calculations for non-convex polygons will not necessarily be accurate. It may
be advantageous to simplify complex geometry in order to shorten the time to run. If it is necessary to use a
non-convex polygon, one approach would be to split it into convex pieces that can be run one-by-one. However,
some visits would then be double-counted and would need to be combined back together based on the
entrance/exit times and sequence of trajectory locations. Multiple polygons would need to be handled with multiple
calls with the output then concatenated together.
</p>
<p>Either single or multiple individuals are supported, but be aware that this function will be slow with
large amounts of data (e.g. millions of points). Multiple individuals are handled via the <code>id</code> column of the 
data.frame.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with several components. <code>revisits</code> is the number of revisits to the polygon. <code>residenceTime</code> is the total time 
spent withing the polygon. <code>radius</code> is NA in the case of polygons. <code>timeunits</code> is the specified time units used to specify timespans.
</p>
<p>When <code>verbose = TRUE</code>, additional information 
is also returned in <code>revisitStats</code>. Next, <code>dists</code> gives the distance matrix between
all locations. Finally, <code>revisitStats</code> gives further statistics on each visit. These are calculated 
per location (i.e., no aggregation of nearby points is performed), and give the index and location
of the point of the track at the center of the radius (NA and 1 in the case of polygons), the radius entrance and exit time of the track for that 
visit, how much time was spent inside the radius, and how long since the last visit (<code>NA</code> for the first visit).
