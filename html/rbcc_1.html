<h2>Package of Risk-based Control Charts</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The risk-based is a new methodology to design an optimized control chart that minimized the cost of decision outcomes of the control process. The basic purpose of the risk-based control is to determine the optimal control charts parameters to minimize the risks arising from measurement uncertainty. This article develops an R package for family of risk-based control charts, namely <code>'rbcc'</code>. In this package, the functions required in the design of family of risk-based control charts univariate and multivariate
