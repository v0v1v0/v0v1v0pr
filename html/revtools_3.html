<h2>Determine optimal way to divide articles among 2 or more reviewers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes information on the number (and optionally, identity) of reviewers and combines it with data on how it should be allocated to return a data.frame showing the proportion of articles to be assessed by each person.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">allocate_effort(reviewers, effort, proportion_checked,
    max_reviewers = 3, precision = 2, quiet = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reviewers</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either an integer giving the number of reviewers, or a vector of strings giving reviewer names.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>effort</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either a single number giving the proportion of articles to be reviewed by all reviewers, or a numeric vector giving a unique proportion for each reviewer. If the latter must be consistent with number given by 'reviewers' above.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>proportion_checked</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric value giving the proportion of entries that should be screened by two or more reviewers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max_reviewers</code></td>
<td>
<p>the maximum number of reviewers that should screen any single article. Useful for avoiding redundancy when working with large teams.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>precision</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of decimal places with which to report results. Defaults to 2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quiet</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical - should the function return a summary of the proportion of articles allocated to each reviewer? Defaults to TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function makes an attempt to return a sensible distribution of effort among a number of reviewers. If effort is given as a single value (or not provided at all), then the result is calculated exactly such that all proportions sum to 1. Conversely, if effort is given as a numeric vector of length &gt;1 and contains a range of values, then the function tries to optimize the proportion of articles allocated to each person, while also matching constrains given by <code>proportion_checked</code> and <code>max_reviewers</code>. In this case, and depending on the inputs, it is possible that no perfect solution will exist, meaning that some reviewers may be allocated a higher proportion of articles than anticipated. For this reason it is often worth setting <code>quiet = FALSE</code> when running <code>allocate_effort</code> with variation in reviewer effort, to allow assessment of the results.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Invisibly returns a data.frame giving one column per reviewer plus an extra column of proportions. The reviewer columns are binary and show which proportions apply to each person or combination of people.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># import some data
file_location &lt;- system.file(
  "extdata",
  "avian_ecology_bibliography.ris",
  package = "revtools")
x &lt;- read_bibliography(file_location)
# simple case - split evenly among 4 reviewers
result &lt;- allocate_effort(4, quiet = TRUE)
# more complex - specify names and amount of overlap
result &lt;- allocate_effort(
  reviewers = c("john", "paul", "george", "ringo"),
  proportion_checked = 0.2,
  max_reviewers = 3,
  quiet = TRUE
  )
# most complex - specify uneven effort among reviewers (experimental)
result &lt;- allocate_effort(
  reviewers = 4,
  effort = c(0.9, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3),
  max_reviewers = 3,
  quiet = TRUE
  )
