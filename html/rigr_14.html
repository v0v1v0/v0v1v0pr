<h2>MRI dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from an observational study of the incidence of cardiovascular disease 
(especially heart attacks and congestive heart failure) and cerebrovascular disease 
(especially strokes) in the U.S. elderly. More information, including a coding key,
is available at

been diagnosed with coronary heart disease prior to MRI (0=no, 1=diagnosis
of angina, 2=diagnosis of myocardial infarction).</p>
</dd>
<dt>stroke</dt>
<dd>
<p>indicator of whether the participant had been
diagnosed with a cerebrovascular event prior to MRI (0=no, 1=diagnosis of a
transient ischemic attack, 2=diagnosis of stroke).</p>
</dd>
<dt>diabetes</dt>
<dd>
<p>indicator of whether the participant had been
diagnosed with diabetes prior to MRI (0=no, 1=yes).</p>

laboratory measure of creatinine, a waste product, in the participant's
blood at the time of MRI (mg/dL).</p>
</dd> 
<dt>plt</dt>
<dd>

time of MRI (1000 per cubic mm).</p>
</dd> 
<dt>sbp</dt>

participant's systolic blood pressure in their arm at the time of MRI (mm
Hg).</p>
</dd> 
<dt>aai</dt>
<dd>

the participant's ankle at time of MRI to the systolic blood pressure in the
participant's arm.</p>
</dd> 
<dt>fev</dt>
<dd>
<p>a measure of the forced expiratory
volume in the participant at the time of MRI (L/sec).</p>
</dd> 
<dt>dsst</dt>
<dd>
<p>a
measure of cognitive function (Digit Symbol Substitution Test) for the
participant at the time of MRI. Maximum score possible is 100.</p>
</dd>
<dt>atrophy</dt>
<dd>
<p>a measure of global brain activity detected on MRI.

<p>an indicator that the
participant was observed to die while on study. If 1, the number of days
recorded in <code>obstime</code> is the number of days from that participant's MRI
