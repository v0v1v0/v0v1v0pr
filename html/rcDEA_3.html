<h2>Graph to select m</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows to draw a graph that relates the number of super efficient units and the choice of m

  B,
  RTS = "crs",
  ORIENTATION = "in",
  check = c(1),
  col = c("black"),
  print = TRUE
)

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function return a plot, representing the percentage of super-efficient units for the different values of m.
A unit is defined as super-efficient if it gets a value higher than a certain treshold (normally 1) in the robust analysis.
Each line of the plot represent different values of the tresholds.
</p>
