<h2>Estimate the evolutionary rate matrix together with the regimes using Markov-chain Monte Carlo</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function runs a MCMC chain to estimate the posterior distribution of the evolutionary rate matrix (R) and the root value (phylogenetic mean). Prior distribution and starting state for the chain can be chosen among pre-defined options or manually set by the user using accompanying functions (see function 'makePrior' for more information). User NEED to provide a directory to write the files (See 'Details'). Use dir="." option to write files to the current directory or provide a name of a folder to be created.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The MCMC chain works by proposing values for the evolutionary rate matrices (R) fitted to the tree and the vector of root values (or phylogenetic mean). The proposal for the R matrices works by separating the variance-covariance matrix into a correlation matrix and a vector of standard deviations and making independent proposals for each. This scheme is called the 'separation strategy' and significantly improves the mix of the chain and also provide a intuitive distinction between the evolutionary correlation among the traits (correlation matrix) and the rates of evolution (standard deviation vector). The proposal for the root values are made all in a single step. <br><br>
The function will print a series of messages to the screen. Those provide details of the setup of the chain, the unique identifier for the files and the log-likelihood of the starting value of the chain. Up to now these messages cannot be disabled. <br><br>
DIRECTORY TO WRITE FILES: User need to specify the directory to write the files. Use "." to write to the current directoy. Or, for example, use "MCMC_files" to create the folder "MCMC_files" in the current directory. RCran policy prohibits the package to automaticaly write to the current directory. <br><br>
DEFAULT PRIOR: The default prior distribution ('uniform_scaled') is composed by a uniform distribution on the root values with range equal to the range observed at the tip data. The size of the window used at each proposal step for the root values is equal to the width of the prior divided by 10 units. For the evolutionary rate matrix, this prior sets a uniform distribution on the correlations (spanning all possible correlation structures) and also a uniform distribution on the vector of standard deviations. The limits of the prior on the standard deviation is computed by first doing a quick Maximum Likelihood estimate of each trait under a single rate BM model and using the results to inform the magnitude of the rates. This default prior distribution might not be the best for your dataset. Keep in mind that the default behavior of the MCMC is to draw a starting point from the prior distribution. Please check the 'makePrior' function for more information on priors and how to make a custom prior distribution.<br><br>
SAMPLE OF TREES: The MCMC chain can integrate the phylogenetic uncertainty or the uncertainty in the rate regimes by randomly sampling a phylogenetic tree from a list of trees. To activate this option, provide a list of 'simmap' or 'phylo' trees as the 'phy' argument. The MCMC will randomly sample a tree each proposal step. Check the 'logAnalyzer' function for more information. <br><br>
MCMC DOES NOT START: It is possible that the starting point shows a very low likelihood value, resulting in the collapse of the chain. This might be a result of a random sample from a very unlikely region of the prior. We suggest that another sample of the prior is taken or that the user make a more suitable prior using the function 'makePrior'. <br><br>
MCMC DOES NOT CONVERGE OR MIX: If the MCMC is taking too long to converge then the parameters of the chain might not be good for your data. First check the 'logAnalyzer' function as well as the 'computeESS'. The recommended acceptance ratio is ~ 0.24, if it is too high, then the step size of the proposals might be too small, try increasing the step size. In contrast, low acceptance ratio might be due to step sizes too large. Try to decrease the size of the steps. If the effective sample size (ESS) for the chain (see 'checkConvergence' and 'computeESS' functions) is to low for some parameter, then try to increase the proportion of times that the parameter is proposed in the MCMC. <br><br>
CANNOT FIND THE POSTERIOR: The function writes the posterior into two files: The '.log' file has the log-likelihood and information about which phylogeny was used, which parameter was proposed and whether the step was accepted or not. The '.mcmc' file has the posterior for the parameters of the model. Those are identified by a name for the chain set by "outname" and an unique series of numbers set by "IDlen". Note that you will need the handle object provided as the output for the function (or saved to the directory if 'save.handle' is TRUE) to be able to load, plot and analyze the posterior distribution.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Function returns the 'handle' object and writes the posterior distribution and log as files in the directory (see 'dir'). The handle is a list with the details of the MCMC chain. It is composed by: *k* the number of traits; *p* the number of R regimes fitted to the tree; *ID* the unique identifier of the run; *dir* the directory where the posterior and log files were saved; *outname* the name for the chain; *trait.names* a vector with the label for the traits; *regime.names* a vector with the label for the rate regimes; *data* the data used in the analysis; *phy* a single phylogeny or the list of phylogenies; *prior* a list with the prior functions; *start* a list with the starting parameters for the chain; *gen* the number of generations for the chain; *mcmc.par* a list with the tunning parameters for the MCMC.
