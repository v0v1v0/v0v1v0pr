<h2>Define the CP</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In general, CP corresponds with specific parts of the analyzed phenomenon at a certain degree of
granularity. To create a computational model of the analyzed phenomenon,
the designer analyzes the everyday use of natural language about the monitored phenomenon with
the aim of identifying different parts (units of information or granules) based on his/her
subjective perceptions. According with Zadeh (1996), a granule is a clump of
elements which are drawn together by indistinguishability, similarity, proximity or functionality.
The GLMP handles granules by using CPs.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cp(name, a, b = NULL, r = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>is the identifier of the CP.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>a</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a vector <code>A = (a1, a2,... , an)</code> of linguistic expressions that
represents the whole linguistic domain of CP, e.g. we have the linguistic domain "statistical data"
that is represented with three linguistic variables (bad, good, very good).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>b</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a vector <code>B = (b1, b2,... , bn)</code> of linguistic expressions (words or
sentences in natural language) that represents the reliability of the CP, e.g., the reliability of
the "statistical data" are (low, moderate, high). By default (<code>b = NULL</code>), the CP does not manage information about reliability.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>r</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a vector <code>R = (r1, r2,... , rn)</code> of relevance degrees 0 &lt;= ri &lt;=1 assigned to each ai in the
specific context, e.g., the relevance of the linguistic expressions (bad, good, very good) is (0.5, 0.5, 1)
means the perception of "very good" is more relevant than the other two choices.
By default (<code>r = NULL</code>), the function create a r vector with the maximum degree of relevance for all linguistic expression, e.g., (1,1,1).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The generated <code>CP = list(a, w, r, b, wb)</code> where <code>w</code> and <code>wb</code> are vectors with the validity degrees (wi and wbi in [0,1]) of the linguistic expressions in <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> respectively.
These vectors are initialized with 0.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">myCP &lt;-cp("myCP", c("bad", "good", "very good"))
myCP &lt;- cp("myCP", c("bad", "good", "very good"), c("low", "moderate", "high"))
myCP &lt;- cp("myCP", c("bad", "good", "very good"), r=c(1,0.8,0.9))
myCP &lt;- cp("myCP", c("bad", "good", "very good"), c("low", "moderate", "high"), c(1,0.8,0.9))
