<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The ABS <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/jobs/weekly-payroll-jobs/latest-release#changes-in-this-release">Weekly Payroll Jobs</a>
dataset is useful to analysts of the Australian labour market.
It draws upon data collected
by the Australian Taxation Office as part of its Single-Touch Payroll
initiative and supplements the monthly Labour Force Survey. Unfortunately,
the data as published by the ABS (1) is not in a standard time series
spreadsheet; and (2) is messy in various ways that make it hard to
read in R. This convenience function uses <code>download_abs_data_cube()</code> to
import the payrolls data, and then tidies it up.
</p>
<p>Note that this ABS release used to be called Weekly Payroll Jobs and Wages Australia.
The total wages series were removed from this release in mid-2023 and it
was renamed to Weekly Payroll Jobs. The ability to read total wages
indexes using this function was therefore also removed.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A tidy (long) <code>tbl_df</code>. The number of columns differs based on the <code>series</code>.
</p>
