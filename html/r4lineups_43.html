<h2>Compute and plot ROC curve for lineup accuracy ~ confidence</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function to compute and plot an ROC curve for data from an eyewitness
experiment, where accuracy is recorded for target present and target
absent lineups
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">make_roc(df_confacc)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df_confacc</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dataframe with two columns, named confidence and accuracy (where accuracy = binary accuracy)</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The approach is outlined in several papers by Mickes, Wixted, Gronlund,
Clark, and others (see <strong>References</strong>)
</p>
<p>This function is a user level function.  It chains the two roc functions
together. The user must pass a dataframe, with one column indicating
confidence, and another accuracy, and these must be named as such.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An ROC object of package pROC
