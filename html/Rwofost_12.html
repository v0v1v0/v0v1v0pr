<h2>
WOFOST Crop Growth Simulation Model
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides an R interface to a C++ implementation of the WOFOST crop growth simulation model.
</p>
<p>This is the first release. Please consider this version unstable. It needs more work to simplify its use.  
</p>
<p>More detailed documentation is also forthcoming, but there is ample general documentation available on-line. The documentation for the FORTRAN version 7.1 is most applicable. For example, <a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/show/WOFOST-7.1-User-Manual.htm">this manual</a>.
</p>
<p>The WOFOST model that this R package uses is written in C++ and it can also be compiled and run as a stand-alone program (see the <a href="https://github.com/cropmodels/Rwofost">github repository</a>. It was derived from the original FORTRAN implementation. It passes the tests cases developed for the PCSE/python version. This suggests that you safely can use the model for "standard" computation of potential and water-limited production.
