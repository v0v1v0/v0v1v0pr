<h2>Extract Year of Birth from the Personal Numeric Code</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function infers the year of birth based on the code for sex - which
is also indicative of the century of birth - and the <code>AA</code> component denoting
the final 2 digits of the birth year. The year is returned as string,
especially since for residents not born in Romania, there might be two
possible valid values for the birth year - in this case the year is returned
as <code>"__yy"</code>
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_birth_year(cnp)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cnp</code></td>
<td>
<p>a 13-digit number (or a vector of 13-digit numbers) representing
the Personal Numeric Code - CNP</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a character vector representing the year of birth (the century is
unknown for non-natives)
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>
