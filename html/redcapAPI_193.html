<h2>Parse Branching Logic</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Branching logic from the REDCap Data Dictionary is parsed into
R Code and returned as expressions.  These can be evaluated if desired
and allow the user to determine if missing values are truly missing or
not required because the branching logic prevented the variable from being
presented.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">parseBranchingLogic(l)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>l</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of REDCap branching logic statements.  These are usually
passed as the vector <code>meta_data$branching_logic</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For a study, I was asked to identify which subjects had missing
values so that remaining data could be collected.  The initial pass of
<code>is.na</code> produced a lot of subjects missing values where there was no
need to collect data because they did not qualify for some variables in
the branching logic.  Parsing the logic allowed me to determine which
values we expected to be missing and narrow the search to just those
subjects with legitimately missing values.
</p>
<p>The utility of this function is limited to simple logic where all of the
data exist within the same row. Any complex statements using events
will result in a failure.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a list of unevaluated expressions.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
parseBranchingLogic("[age] &gt; 30")
parseBranchingLogic("[dropdown_test] = 'd'")
parseBranchingLogic(c("[age] &gt; 30", 
                      "[dropdown_test] = 'd'"))

## End(Not run)
