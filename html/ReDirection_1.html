<h2>calculate_reaction_vector()
This is the main function of the package 'ReDirection'.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The input stoichiometry matrix of a generic biochemical network is checked
and modified after which the null space is computed.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">calculate_reaction_vector(smat, rar)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>smat</code></td>
<td>
<p>An input stoichiometry matrix of a generic biochemical network.
This is a mandatory argument.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rar</code></td>
<td>
<p>A mandatory logical argument that indicates the orientation of the
reactions as rows (TRUE) or columns (FALSE) in the stoichiometry matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The non-zero null space spanning and the subspace-generated unique reaction
vectors (RVs) are recursively summed combinatorially and evaluated for
redundancy.
</p>
<p>The function compares the generated subspace vectors reaction-wise, i.e., as
sequences of identical terms across all RVs. These are then evaluated on the
basis of pre-defined criteria (descriptive statistics, linear maps, tests of
convergence, probability of occurrence, vector norms).
</p>
<p>The output for each reaction is the combined propensity (p1-norm) of the sub-
propensities and is strictly positive. This is the probable rate constant, is
used to infer the dominant direction of each reaction and annotate a reaction
as "Forward (f)" or "Reverse (b)" or "Equivalent (e)".
Although, there is no restriction on the number of reactions, the inherent
computational complexity (NP-hard) involved per iteration suggests that an
suitable value for the number of reactions is around 20.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>code A numerically encoded ('0', no success; '1', success) text
message to the user and indicates the outcome of utilizing "ReDirection".
