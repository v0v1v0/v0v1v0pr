<h2>Business simulation game data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data were collected from 354 senior business administration students
during a business simulation game at a Western European University.
</p>
<p>The game was played for a total of 12 rounds (i.e., two separate games of 6
rounds) as part of the capstone strategy class.  Students were randomly
assigned to teams of four, and surveyed in three waves: prior to the first
game, in between the two games, and after the second game (with different
variables being surveyed in the different waves).
</p>
<p>The 354 students formed 92 teams, and the responses of individual students
were aggregated to the team level.  Leaving out teams with less than 50
percent response rate yields <code class="reqn">n = 89</code> teams.  Only a small subset of the
collected variables are included here.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("BSG2014")
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 89 observations on the following 13 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>ProcessConflict</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Based on Shah &amp; Jehn (1993), the team
members rated three items on the presence of conflict related to the
process of working together, using a 5-point scale (1 = none, 5 = a lot).
The individual responses were aggregated by taking the average across
items and team members.  Process conflict was measured in the second
survey (between the two games).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>SharedExperience</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>As teams were randomly formed, no prior
shared group experience is expected, and shared group experience and
training is developed during the first game for the second game.  Hence
the team performance score on the first game is used as a proxy for the
level of shared group experience and training.  Those scores were computed
through a mix of five objective performance measures: return on equity,
earnings-per-share, stock price, credit rating, and image rating.  The
computation of the scores is handled by the simulation game software, and
details can be found in Mathieu &amp; Rapp (2009).  The scores ranged from 57
to 111, and they were communicated to the teams only after the third
survey.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>TaskConflict</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Using the intra-group conflict scale of Jehn
(1995), the team members rated four items on the presence of conflict
regarding the work on a 5-point scale (1 = none, 5 = a lot).
The individual responses were aggregated by taking the average across
items and team members.  Task conflict was measured in the second survey
(between the two games).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>TeamCommitment</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The team members indicated the extent to
which they agree or disagree with four items on commitment to the team,
which are based on Mowday, Steers &amp; Porter (1979), using a 5-point scale
(1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree).  The individual responses
were aggregated by taking the average across items and team members.
Team commitment was measured in the third survey (after the second game).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>TeamPerformance</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Following Hackman (1986), the team members
indicated the extent to which they agree or disagree with four items on
the team's functioning, using a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 =
strongly agree).  The individual responses were aggregated by taking the
average across items and team members.  Subjective team performance was
measured in the third survey (after the second game).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>TMS</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Transactive memory systems (TMS) are defined as shared
systems that people in relationships develop for encoding, storing, and
retrieving information about different substantive domains.  TMS was
operationalized with Lewis’ (2003) 15-item scale that measures the three
sub-dimensions of TMS (specialization, credibility, and coordination).
For each item, the team members responded on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly
disagree, 5 = strongly agree).  Following Lewis (2003), the three sub
dimensions were aggregated to form the TMS construct.  That is, the
individual responses were aggregated by taking the average across all 15
items and team members.  TMS was measured in the second survey (between
the two games).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ValueDiversity</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Using the short Schwartz’s value survey
(Lindeman &amp; Verkasalo, 2005), the team members rated ten items on the
importance of certain values (1 = not important, 10 = highly important).
For each value item, the coefficient of variation of the individual
responses across team members was computed, and the resulting coefficients
of variation were averaged across the value items.  Value diversity was
measured in the first survey (before the first game).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ProceduralJustice</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Based on the intra-unit procedural justice
climate scale of Li &amp; Cropanzano (2009), the team members indicated the
extent to which they agree or disagree with four items on a 5-point scale
(1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree).  The individual responses
were aggregated by taking the average across items and team members.
Procedural justice was measured in the third survey (after the second
game).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>InteractionalJustice</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Using the intra-unit interactional
justice climate scale of Li &amp; Cropanzano (2009), the team members
indicated the extent to which they agree or disagree with four items on a
5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree).  The individual
responses were aggregated by taking the average across items and team
members.  Interactional justice was measured in the third survey (after
the second game).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>SharedLeadership</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Following Carson, Tesluk &amp; Marrone (2007),
every team member assessed each of their peers on the question of
‘To what degree does your team rely on this individual for
leadership?’ using a 5-point scale (1 = not at all, 5 = to a very large
extent).  The leadership ratings were aggregated by taking the sum and
dividing it by the number of pairwise relationships among team members.
Shared leadership was measured in the second survey (between the two
games).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>AgeDiversity</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Following Harrison &amp; Klein (2007), age
diversity was operationalized by the coefficient of variation of the
team members' ages.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>GenderDiversity</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Gender diversity was measured with Blau's
index, <code class="reqn">1 - \sum_{j} p_{j}^{2}</code>, where <code class="reqn">p_{j}</code> is the proportion of team members in the
<code class="reqn">j</code>-th category (Blau, 1977).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>TeamScore</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The team performance scores on the second game
were computed at the end of the simulation through a mix of five objective
performance measures: return on equity, earnings-per-share, stock price,
credit rating, and image rating. The computation of the scores is handled
by the simulation game software, and details can be found in Mathieu &amp;
Rapp (2009).  The scores ranged from 49 to 110, and they were communicated
to the teams only after the third survey.</p>
