<h2>Sample dataset to illustrate Rattle functionality.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The audit dataset is an artificially constructed dataset that has some
of the characteristics of a true financial audit dataset for modelling
productive and non-productive audits of a person's financial
statement. A productive audit is one which identifies errors or
inaccuracies in the information provided by a client. A non-productive
audit is usually an audit which found all supplied information to be
in order.
</p>
<p>The audit dataset is used to illustrate binary classification.  The
target variable is identified as <code>TARGET\_Adjusted</code>.
</p>
<p>The dataset is quite small, consisting of just 2000 entities. Its
primary purpose is to illustrate modelling in Rattle, so a minimally
sized dataset is suitable.
</p>
<p>The dataset itself is derived from publicly available data (which has
nothing to do with audits).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame. In line with data mining terminology we refer to the
rows of the data frame (or the observations) as entities. The columns
are refered to as variables.  The entities represent people in this
case. We describe the variables here:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>ID</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a unique identifier for each person.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Age</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The age.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Employment</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The type of employment.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Education</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The highest level of education.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Marital</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Current marital status.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Occupation</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The type of occupation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Income</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The amount of income declared.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Gender</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The persons gender.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Deductions</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Total amount of expenses that a person
claims in their financial statement.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Hours</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The average hours worked on a weekly basis.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>IGNORE_Accounts</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The main country in which the person
has most of their money banked. Note that the variable name is
prefixed with IGNORE. This is recognised by Rattle as the default
role for this variable.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>RISK_Adjustment</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This variable records the monetary
amount of any adjustment to the person's financial claims as a
result of a productive audit. This variable, which should not be
treated as an input variable, is thus a measure of the size of the
risk associated with the person.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>TARGET_Adjusted</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The target variable for modelling
(generally for classification modelling). This is a numeric field
of class integer, but limited to 0 and 1, indicating
non-productive and productive audits, respectively. Productive
audits are those that result in an adjustment being made to a
client's financial statement.</p>
