<h2>Get Datasets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Downloads datasets you have access to from the DHS website
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_datasets(
  dataset_filenames,
  download_option = "rds",
  reformat = FALSE,
  all_lower = TRUE,
  output_dir_root = NULL,
  clear_cache = FALSE,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dataset_filenames</code></td>
<td>
<p>The desired filenames to be downloaded. These can be
found as one of the returned fields from <code>dhs_datasets</code>.
Alternatively you can also pass the desired rows from
<code>dhs_datasets</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>download_option</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character specifying whether the dataset should be
just downloaded ("zip"), imported and saved as an .rds object ("rds"), or
both extract and rds ("both"). Conveniently you can just specify any letter
from these options.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reformat</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean concerning whether to reformat read in datasets by
removing all factors and labels. Default = FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>all_lower</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical indicating whether all value labels should be lower
case. Default to 'TRUE'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>output_dir_root</code></td>
<td>
<p>Root directory where the datasets will be stored
within. The default will download
datasets to a subfolder of the client root called "datasets"</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>clear_cache</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should your available datasets cache be cleared first.
This will allow newly accessed datasets to be available. Default = 'FALSE'</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Any other arguments to be passed to <code>read_dhs_dataset</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Gets datasets from your cache or downloads from the DHS website.
By providing the filenames, as specified in one of the returned fields
from <code>dhs_datasets</code>, the client will log in for you and download
all the files you have requested. If any of the requested files are
unavailable for your log in, these will be flagged up first as a message so
you can make a note and request them through the DHS website. You also have
the option to control whether the downloaded zip file is then extracted and
converted into a more convenient R <code>data.frame</code>. This converted object
will then be subsequently saved as a ".rds" object within the client root
directory datasets folder, which can then be more quickly loaded when
needed with <code>readRDS</code>. You also have the option to reformat the
dataset, which will ensure that the datasets returned are encoded simply
as character strings, i.e. there are no factors or labels.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Depends on the download_option requested, but ultimately it is a file
path to where the dataset was downloaded to, so that you can interact with
it accordingly.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> ## Not run: 
# get the model datasets included with the package
model_datasets &lt;- model_datasets

# download one of them
g &lt;- get_datasets(dataset_filenames = model_datasets$FileName[1])

## End(Not run)
</code></pre>
