<h2>Robust linear mixed effects models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>robustlmm</code> provides functions for estimating linear mixed effects
models in a robust way.
</p>
<p>The main workhorse is the function <code>rlmer</code>; it is implemented
as direct robust analogue of the popular <code>lmer</code> function of
the <code>lme4</code> package. The two functions have similar abilities
and limitations. A wide range of data structures can be modeled: mixed
effects models with hierarchical as well as complete or partially crossed
random effects structures are possible. While the <code>lmer</code>
function is optimized to handle large datasets efficiently, the
computations employed in the <code>rlmer</code> function are more
complex and for this reason also more expensive to compute. The two
functions have the same limitations in the support of different random
effect and residual error covariance structures. Both support only
diagonal and unstructured random effect covariance structures.
</p>
<p>The <code>robustlmm</code> package implements most of the analysis tool chain
as is customary in R. The usual functions such as <code>summary</code>,
<code>coef</code>, <code>resid</code>, etc. are provided as long as
they are applicable for this type of models (see
<code>rlmerMod-class</code> for a full list). The functions are designed
to be as similar as possible to the ones in the <code>lme4</code>
package to make switching between the two packages easy.
</p>
<p>Details on the implementation and example analyses are provided in the
package vignette available via <code>vignette("rlmer")</code> (Koller 2016).
