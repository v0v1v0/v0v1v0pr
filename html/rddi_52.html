</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>ddi_actMin()</code>is the summary of actions taken to minimize data loss.
Includes information on actions such as follow-up visits, supervisory
checks, historical matching, estimation, etc.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ddi_cleanOps()</code> are the methods used to "clean" the data collection,
e.g., consistency checking, wild code checking, etc. The "agency" attribute
permits specification of the agency doing the data cleaning.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ddi_collectorTraining()</code> describes the training provided to data
collectors including interviewer training, process testing, compliance with
standards etc. This is repeatable for language and to capture different
aspects of the training process. The type attribute allows specification of
the type of training being described.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ddi_collMode()</code> is the method used to collect the data; instrumentation
characteristics.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ddi_collSitu()</code> is the description of noteworthy aspects of the data
collection situation. Includes information on factors such as
cooperativeness of respondents, duration of interviews, number of
call-backs, etc.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ddi_ConOps()</code> are control operations. These are methods to facilitate
data control performed by the primary investigator or by the data archive.
Specify any special programs used for such operations. The "agency"
attribute maybe used to refer to the agency that performed the control
operation.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ddi_dataCollector()</code> is the entity (individual, agency, or institution)
responsible for administering the questionnaire or interview or compiling
the data. This refers to the entity collecting the data, not to the entity
producing the documentation.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ddi_deviat()</code> are major deviations from the sample design. This is
information indicating correspondence as well as discrepancies between the
sampled units (obtained) and available statistics for the population (age,
sex-ratio, marital status, etc.) as a whole.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ddi_frequenc()</code> is the frequency of data collection. It's for data
collected at more than one point in time.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ddi_instrumentDevelopment()</code> describes any development work on the data
collection instrument.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ddi_resInstru()</code> is the type of data collection instrument used.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ddi_sampProc()</code> is the type of sample and sample design used to select
the survey respondents to represent the population. May include reference
to the target sample size and the sampling fraction.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ddi_weight()</code> defines the weights used to produce accurate statistical
results within the sampling procedures. Describe here the criteria for
using weights in analysis of a collection. If a weighting formula or
coefficient was developed, provide this formula, define its elements, and
indicate how the formula is applied to data.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A ddi_node object.
</p>


<h3>Shared and complex child nodes</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>ddi_sampleFrame()</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ddi_sources()</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ddi_targetSampleSize()</code>
