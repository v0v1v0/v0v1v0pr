<h2>
Data for First Kidney Transplant Recipients.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data were extracted from the DIVAT cohort. It corresponds to the reference sample constituted by first transplant recipients (FTR).  
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(dataFTR)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with the 4 following variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Tps.Evt</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This numeric vector provides the post-transplantation time (in days).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Evt</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This numeric vector provides the indicator of graft failure at the end of the follow-up (1 for failure and 0 for right censoring).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ageR2cl</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This numeric vector provides the recipient age at transplantation (1 for older than 55 years and 0 otherwise).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sexeR</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This numeric vector provides the recipient gender (1 for men and 0 for women).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>First transplant recipients (FTR) constituted the reference group. Recipients older than 18 years at the date of transplantation between 1996 and 2010 were selected from the French DIVAT (www.divat.fr/en) multicentric prospective cohort. Only recipients with a maintenance therapy with calcineurin inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors or belatacept, in addition to mycophenolic acid and steroid were included. Simultaneous transplantations were excluded. Two explicative variables are proposed: recipient age at transplantation and recipient gender.
