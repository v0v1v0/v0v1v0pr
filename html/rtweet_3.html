<h2>Mark a user id as a screen name</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>There are two ways to identify a Twitter user: a screen name (e.g.
"justinbieber") or a user identifier (e.g. "27260086"). User identifiers
look like regular numbers, but are actually 64-bit integers which can't be
stored in R's numeric vectors. For this reason, rtweet always returns ids as
strings.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately this introduces an ambiguity, because user names can
also consist solely of numbers (e.g. "123456") so it's not obvious whether
a string consisting only of numbers is a screen name or a user id. By
default, rtweet will assume its a user id, so if you have a screen name
that consists only of numbers, you'll need to use <code>as_screenname()</code> to
tell rtweet that it's actually a screen name.
</p>
<p>Note that in general, you are best off using user ids; screen names are
not static and may change over longer periods of time.
