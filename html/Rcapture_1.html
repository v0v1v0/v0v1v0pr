<p>DESCRIPTION OF DATA SET FORMATS
</p>
<p>In capture-recapture experiments, the data collected consist of capture histories for captured units. A capture history is simply a serie of capture indicators for each capture event in the experiment. The capture history of one unit is expressed as a length <code class="reqn">t</code> vector <code class="reqn">w = (w_1, \ldots, w_t)</code>, where <code class="reqn">w_j = 1</code> if the unit is captured at the jth occasion and 0 if not. For closed populations, capture events are named capture occasions, whereas they are named capture periods for open populations.
</p>
<p>Capture-recapture data sets are given to <span class="pkg">Rcapture</span> functions through the <code>X</code> argument. <code>X</code> must be a numeric matrix. Arguments <code>dfreq</code> and <code>dtype</code> indicate the format of the matrix. Each have two possible values, meaning that four data set formats are possible with <span class="pkg">Rcapture</span>.<br></p>
<p>FORMAT 1 - CAPTURE HISTORY PER UNIT<br>
If <code>dfreq=FALSE</code> and <code>dtype="hist"</code> (the default), <code>X</code> has one row per unit captured in the experiment. Each row is an observed capture history. It must contain only zeros and ones; the number one indicates a capture. In this case, the number of columns in the table represents the number of capture occasions in the experiment (noted <code class="reqn">t</code>). Here is an example of a data set of this type for <code class="reqn">t=2</code>:<br>
1 1<br>
1 1<br>
1 0<br>
1 0<br>
1 0<br>
1 0<br>
0 1<br></p>
<p>FORMAT 2 - AGGREGATED CAPTURE HISTORIES<br>
If <code>dfreq=TRUE</code> and <code>dtype="hist"</code>, <code>X</code> contains one row per observed capture history followed by its frequency. In that case, <code>X</code> has <code class="reqn">t</code>+1 columns. As for format 1, the first <code class="reqn">t</code> columns of <code>X</code>, identifying the capture histories, must contain only zeros and ones. The number one indicates a capture. In this format, 
the example data set is represented by the following matrix:<br>
1 1 2<br>
1 0 4<br>
0 1 1<br>
If a possible capture history is not observed, it can appear in <code>X</code> with a frequency of zero, or it can simply be omitted.<br></p>
<p>FORMAT 3 - NUMBER OF CAPTURES PER UNIT<br>
If <code>dfreq=FALSE</code> and <code>dtype="nbcap"</code>, <code>X</code> is a vector with the number of captures for every captured unit. Therefore, this format does not contain complete capture histories. Instead, capture histories are summarized through the number of captures. In this format, the example data set looks like:<br>
2 2 1 1 1 1 1<br></p>
<p>FORMAT 4 - AGGREGATED NUMBERS OF CAPTURES<br>
If <code>dfreq=TRUE</code> and <code>dtype="nbcap"</code>, <code>X</code> is a 2 columns matrix. The first column contains the observed numbers of captures, the second columns contains their frequencies. 
In this format, the example data is:<br>
2 2<br>
1 5<br></p>
<p>DETAILS ABOUT FORMATS WITH NUMBERS OF CAPTURES
</p>
<p>Only few functions have the <code>dtype</code> argument. Functions without <code>dtype</code> argument accept only a data matrix <code>X</code> of the form <code>dtype="hist"</code>. So the first two formats listed above are the most common.
</p>
<p>Formats with <code>dtype="nbcap"</code> are used for captures in continuous time (see below). They are also useful to reduce the size of the data set for experiments with a large number of capture occasions <code class="reqn">t</code> (often with no units caught a large number of times). For theses formats, the number of capture occasions <code class="reqn">t</code> cannot be deduced from <code>X</code> as it can be with <code>dtype="hist"</code>. One has no garanties that the larger number of captures observed is the total number of capture occasions. Therefore, if one gives a data matrix <code>X</code> with <code>dtype="nbcap"</code>, one must also provide <code>t</code>, the number of capture occasions, as an additional argument.  
</p>
<p>For now, the data formats with <code>dtype="nbcap"</code> are not generalized to the robust design. So <code>dtype</code> is not an argument of the <code>robustd.0</code> function.<br></p>
<p>CAPTURES IN CONTINUOUS TIME
</p>
<p>In some capture-recapture experiments, there is no well defined capture occasions. 
Captures occur in continuous time. The data set <code>ill</code> comes from
such an experiment. Bohning and Schon (2005) call this type of capture-recapture 
data <em>repeated counting data</em>. These data sets always have the format <code>dtype="nbcap"</code>. 
</p>
<p>We can estimate abundance for data of this type using the option <code>t=Inf</code> with the
functions <code>closedpCI.0</code> and <code>closedpCI.0</code>. The function 
<code>descriptive</code> also accepts <code>t=Inf</code>. It modifies the y coordinate
of the exploratory heterogeneity graph.<br></p>
<p>DISTINCTION BETWEEN <code>.t</code> and <code>.0</code> FUNCTIONS
</p>
<p>Capture recapture models for closed population aim at estimating the population size by modelling the probabilities of the different capture histories. The data available to fit these models consist of observed frequencies of capture histories. These frequencies are modeled in Rcapture using loglinear models for frequency tables. For functions with a name ending with <code>.t</code> (<code>closedp.t</code>, <code>closedpCI.t</code>, <code>closedpMS.t</code> and <code>robustd.t</code>), the observed values of the response variable is the vector of frequencies for every observable capture history. It has length <code class="reqn">2^t-1</code>.
</p>
<p>However, for a model without temporal effect (assuming that the probability of capturing a unit does not vary between capture occasions), all the information needed to fit the model can be found in aggregated data. Functions with a name ending with <code>.0</code> (<code>closedp.0</code>, <code>closedpCI.0</code> and <code>robustd.0</code>) fit models using as response variable the number of units captured <code class="reqn">i</code> times, for <code class="reqn">i=1,\ldots,t</code>. It is a vector of length <code class="reqn">t</code>, which is much shorter than <code class="reqn">2^t-1</code> for a large <code class="reqn">t</code>. Because of an appropriate offset added to the model, the results from a <code>.0</code> function match exaclty the results from a <code>.t</code> function for a corresponding capture-recapture model. Because <code>.0</code> functions deal with smaller design matrix, they run faster than <code>.t</code> functions, but they cannot fit models with a temporal effect. <br></p>
<p>FUNCTIONS USED FOR MODEL FITTING
</p>
<p>Most of the <span class="pkg">Rcapture</span> functions use the function <code>glm</code> of the <span class="pkg">stats</span> package to fit a loglinear model. However, the function <code>optim</code>, again of the <span class="pkg">stats</span>, is also used by three functions:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>closedpCI.t</code>, <code>closedpCI.0</code> and <code>closedpMS.t</code>: when a normal heterogeneous models is requested,
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>closedp.Mtb</code>: because model Mtb does not have a loglinear form.<br></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ERRORS AND WARNINGS MANAGEMENT IN CLOSED POPULATION FUNCTIONS
</p>
<p>If an error occurs while executing a function fitting only one closed population model (<code>closedpCI</code> functions, <code>closedp.bc</code>, <code>closedp.Mtb</code>), the execution is stopped and the error message is printed (usual behavior in R). However, if an error occurs while fitting a model in a call to a closedp population function fitting more than one model (<code>closedp</code> functions, <code>closedpMS.t</code>), the execution of the call is not stopped. Instead, the row in the results table for the problematic model is filled with <code>NA</code> and the error message is stored in an output value. This value is called <code>glm.err</code> for <code>closedp</code> functions. It is however called <code>fit.err</code> for <code>closedpMS.t</code> because this function do not always use <code>glm</code> to fit the model (as mentionned above, <code>optim</code> is used for normal heterogeneous models).
</p>
<p>Warning messages while fitting a closed population model, if any, are stored in an output value called 'glm.warn', 'fit.warn' or 'optim.warn' depending on the function. They are not printed in the console. To inform the user that a warning occured, the last column of the results table, named <code>infoFit</code>, contains a numerical code giving information about errors or warnings encountered. Here is a description of the meaning of the numerical code:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>   0</dt>
<dd>
<p>  no error or warning occured while fitting the model;</p>
</dd>
<dt>  -1</dt>
<dd>
<p>  an error occured while fitting the model;</p>
</dd>
<dt>   1</dt>
<dd>
<p>  a warning indicating that the model fit is questionnable occured (algorithm did not converge, non-positive sigma estimate for a normal heterogeneous model or large asymptotic bias);</p>
</dd> 
<dt>   2</dt>
<dd>
<p>  the warning 'design matrix not of full rank' occured, therefore some model's coefficients are not estimable;</p>
</dd>
<dt>   3</dt>
<dd>
<p>  a warning not of type 1 or 2 occured (the <code>glm</code> warning 'fitted rates nummerically 0 occured' is often encountered with small frequencies, it does not always mean that the model fit is questionnable).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The elements in the column <code>infoFit</code> can contain more than one number since more than one warning can occur. For exemple, if <code>infoFit</code> takes the value <code>13</code> for a model, it means that at least one warning of type 1 and one warning of type 3 have occured. If more than one warning of the same type are encountered, the number representing the type of warning is not repeated in <code>infoFit</code>.
