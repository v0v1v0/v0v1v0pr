<h2>
Set the observer location
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function sets the location of the viewer.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">observer3d(x, y = NULL, z = NULL, auto = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x, y, z</code></td>
<td>

<p>The location as a 3 vector, using the usual <code>xyz.coords</code>
conventions for specification.  If <code>x</code> is missing
or any coordinate is <code>NA</code>, no change will be made to the
location.  
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>auto</code></td>
<td>
 
<p>If <code>TRUE</code>, the location will be set 
automatically by RGL to make the whole bounding box visible.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function
sets the location of the viewer relative to the scene, after the model transformations
(scaling, rotation) have been done, but before lighting or projection have been 
applied.  (See <code>par3d</code> for details on the rendering pipeline.)
</p>
<p>The coordinate system is a slightly strange one:  the X coordinate
moves the observer location from left to right, and the Y coordinate moves up
and down.  The Z coordinate changes the depth from the viewer.  All are measured
relative to the center of the bounding box (<code>par("bbox")</code>) of the subscene.
The observer always looks in the positive Z direction
after the model rotation have been done.  The coordinates are in post-scaling
units.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Invisibly returns the previous value.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function is likely to change in future versions of RGL, to allow more 
flexibility in the specification of the observer's location and orientation.
