<h2>Find the Degree of Vertices in a Hypergraph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The degree of a vertex is a way of expressing how many connections there
are from a vertex to the rest of the hypergraph. The current version of
rhype has three methods for computing degree.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">degree(hype, method = "vertex")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hype</code></td>
<td>
<p>A hypergraph object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>The method for calculating degree. Out of <code>"vertex"</code>,
<code>"vertex_simple"</code>, <code>"hyperedge"</code> and <code>"hyperedge_simple"</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>"vertex"</code> counts the number of ways it is possible to move to another
vertex. If there are multiple hyperedges connecting two vertices, then each
of these hyperedges will be counted as a new way to move between these two
vertices. For weighted hypergraphs or hypergraphs with real coefficients,
the strength of connection between two vertices is a functions of the weights
and real coefficients.
</p>
<p><code>"vertex_simple"</code> just counts the number of vertices it is possible to reach
in one step from the given vertex, no matter how many hyperedges connect them.
</p>
<p><code>"hyperedge"</code> represents the strength with which a vertex connects with
itself through the hyperedges it is a member of. This is taken from the work
of Jurgen Jost and Raffaella Mulas doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aim.2019.05.025">10.1016/j.aim.2019.05.025</a>. For
unweighted hypergraphs without real coefficients this is equivalent to
<code>"hyperedge_simple"</code>.
</p>
<p><code>"hyperedge_simple"</code> just counts the number of hyperedges a vertex is a
member of.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector representing the degree of each vertex with respect to the
given method.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">h1 &lt;- example_hype()
degree(h1)
</code></pre>
