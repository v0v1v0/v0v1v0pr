<h2>List temporary files created by Rsagacmd</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For convenience, functions in the Rsagacmd package create temporary files if
any outputs for a SAGA-GIS tool are not specified as arguments. Temporary
files in R are automatically removed at the end of each session. However,
when dealing with raster data, these temporary files potentially can consume
large amounts of disk space. These temporary files can be observed during a
session by using the saga_show_tmpfiles function, and can be removed using
the saga_remove_tmpfiles function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">saga_show_tmpfiles()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>returns the file names of the files in the temp directory that have
been generated by Rsagacmd. Note this list of files only includes the
primary file extension, i.e. '.shp' for a shapefile without the accessory
files (e.g. .prj, .shx etc.).
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# Show all temporary files generated by Rsagacmd
saga_remove_tmpfiles(h = 0)

## End(Not run)
</code></pre>
