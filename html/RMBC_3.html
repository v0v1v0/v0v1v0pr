<h2>Phytoplankton_acoustic_data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data obtained by taking laboratory measurements of ultrasonic acoustic signals: 
a pulse is emitted by a transducer, this pulse interacts with phytoplankton 
suspended in the water and produces an acoustic dispersion (scattering), 
which is recorded by an electronic acquisition device.
A filtering process of the signal is performed in a first stage. 
Portions of the signal belong o one of the two main cases:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>(a) Signals corresponding to the acoustic response of phytoplankton
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(b) Signals corresponding to spurious dispersers, such as bubbles or 
particles in suspension, whose intensity is greater than in case (a). 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To classify a signal in one of these two groups biologists create a vector 
(X1, X2) defined as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> X1 = ratio of filtered to non-filtered signal power
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> X2 = filtered signal power expressed in dB.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The available data consists of 375 such measurements. These data is particularly 
useful to compare robust procedures because 20
to be outliers produced by a communication failure between the electronic device 
(digital oscilloscope) and the software for acquiring the acoustic signal. 
This failure occurs once every 5 microseconds, which allows the scientists 
to identify the outliers. The outliers appear 
as a separated group in the region X1 &lt; 0.5 and X2 &gt; 20.
