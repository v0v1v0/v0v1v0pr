<h2>Create balanced blocks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Separates the network into a series of bi-connected components that can be solved separately. 
Solving smaller subgraphs using the bi-connected component method reduces the risk of network divergence.
This function is seldom called independently of setse_bicomp
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">create_balanced_blocks(g, force = "force", bigraph = bigraph)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>g</code></td>
<td>
<p>An igraph object. The network for which embeddings will be found</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>force</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector. The name of the node attribute that is the force exerted by the nodes</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bigraph</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list. the list of biconnected components produced by the biconnected_components function.
This function take a non trivial amount of time on large graphs so this pass through minimises the function being called.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When networks are separated into the bi-connected subgraphs or blocks. The overall network balance needs to be maintained. 
<code>create_balanced_blocks</code> maintains the balance by summing the net force across the all the nodes that are being removed from
the subgraph. Therefore a node that is an articulation point has a force value equal to the total of all the nodes on the adjacent
bi-connected component.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing all the bi connected component where each component is balanced to have a net force of 0.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">library(igraph)
#create a list of balanced network using the biconnected_network dataset
balanced_list &lt;-create_balanced_blocks(biconnected_network, 
bigraph = biconnected_components(biconnected_network))

#count the edges in each of the bi-components
sapply(balanced_list, ecount)
