<h2>RTCC: Detecting trait clustering in environmental gradients
with the Randomized Trait Community Clustering method</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A set of functions which allows to determine if the observed traits
present clustering/overdispersion patterns on the observed samples,
and if so, to stablish if the observed pattern is linked to the effect
of an environmental gradient.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The study of phenotypic similarities and differences within species along
environmental gradients might be used as a powerful tool complementing
taxon-based approaches when assesing the contribution of stochastic and
deterministic processes in community assembly. For this, this package allows an
easy implementation of a method for detecting clustering/overdispersion patterns
along an environmental gradient (Triado-Margarit et al., 2019). A first function
assesses if the observed traits exhibit a clustering/overdispersion pattern on the
tested samples. If positive, two subsequent functions determine whether the
observed pattern is linked to the effect of an environmental varible and its
statistical significance.
</p>


<h3>Data entry</h3>

<p>The data consists on presence-absence observations
along a measured environmental gradient and trait quantitative
information of the observed organisms.
