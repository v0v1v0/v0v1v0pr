<h2>
Generate a Random Data from Discrete Probability Function
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generates random data from a given empirical probability function. It also returns cumulative distribution function corresponding to the entered probability function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rDiscrete(n = 1, pf)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>

<p>number of observations.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pf</code></td>
<td>

<p>empirical probability function.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>pf</code> is an array of any dimensionality with all elements sum up to one. If its dimension is greater than one, it is transformed to a row vector column-by-column. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list including 
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rdiscrete</code></td>
<td>
<p>an <code class="reqn">nx1</code> vector that gives generated random data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cdf</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector including cumulative distribution function.</p>
</td>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">p = c(0.23,0.11,0.05,0.03,0.31,0.03,0.22,0.02)
rDiscrete(n=2,pf=p)

# pf would be entered as a matrix:

p = matrix(c(0.23,0.11,0.05,0.03,0.31,0.03,0.22,0.02), nrow=2, ncol=4, byrow = TRUE) 
rDiscrete(n=2,pf=p)

p = matrix(c(0.23,0.11,0.05,0.03,0.31,0.03,0.22,0.02), nrow=4, ncol=2, byrow = TRUE) 
rDiscrete(n=2,pf=p)

# or pf would be entered as a three dimensional array:

p = array(c(0.23,0.11,0.05,0.03,0.31,0.03,0.22,0.02), dim=c(2,2,2))
rDiscrete(n=2,pf=p)
