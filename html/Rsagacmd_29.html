<h2>Removes temporary files created by Rsagacmd</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For convenience, functions in the Rsagacmd package create temporary files if
any outputs for a SAGA-GIS tool are not specified as arguments. Temporary
files in R are automatically removed at the end of each session. However,
when dealing with raster data, these temporary files potentially can consume
large amounts of disk space. These temporary files can be observed during a
session by using the saga_show_tmpfiles function, and can be removed using
the saga_remove_tmpfiles function. Note that this function also removes any
accompanying files, i.e. the '.prj' and '.shx' files that may be written as
part of writing a ESRI Shapefile '.shp' format
