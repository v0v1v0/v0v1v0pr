<h2>Sample query table from SNOMED CT dictionary</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

for inactive concepts.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(QUERY)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>"data.table"</code>
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p>supertypeId integer64: concept ID of the ancestor (active) concept 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>subtypeId integer64: concept ID of the descendant (inactive) concept 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provenance integer: provenance of relationship. Provenance = 0 means subsumption is always true. Provenance = 1 means subsumption is usually true (but there is a theoretical risk of false positives). Provenance = 2 means both ancestors and descendents are only approximately known. Provenance = 3 means original code had at least two distinct meanings and all are being returned
