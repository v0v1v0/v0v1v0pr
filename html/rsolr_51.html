<h2>Promises</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>Promise</code> class formally and abstractly represents the
potential result of a deferred computation. 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Lazy programming is useful in a number of contexts, including
interaction with external/remote systems like databases, where we want
the computation to occur within the external system, despite
appearances to the contrary. Typically, the user constructs one or
more promises referring to pre-existing objects. Operations on those
objects produce new promises that encode the additional
computations. Eventually, usually after some sort of restriction
and/or aggregation, the promise is “fulfilled” to yield a
materialized, eager object, such as an R vector.
</p>
<p><code>Promise</code> and its partial implementation <code>SimplePromise</code>
provide a foundation for implementations that mostly helps with
creating and fulfilling promises, while the implementation is
responsible for deferring particular computations, which is
language-dependent.
</p>


<h3>Construction</h3>


<ul><li>
<p><code>Promise(expr, context, ...)</code>: A generic constructor that
dispatches on <code>expr</code> to construct a <code>Promise</code> object,
the specific type of which corresponds to the language of
<code>expr</code>. The <code>context</code> argument should be a
<code>Context</code> object, in which <code>expr</code> will be evaluated when
the promise is fulfilled. The <code>...</code> are passed to methods.

</p>
</li></ul>
<h3>Fulfillment</h3>


<ul><li>
<p><code>fulfill(x)</code>: Fulfills the promise by evaluating the deferred
computation and returning a materialized object.

</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The basic coercion functions in R, like <code>as.vector</code> and
<code>as.data.frame</code>, have methods for <code>Promise</code> that simply call
<code>fulfill</code> on the promise, and then perform the coercion. Coercion
is preferred to calling <code>fulfill</code> directly.
