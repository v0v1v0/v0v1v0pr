<h2>Calculate excess kurtosis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Kurtosis is a summary of a distribution's shape, using the Normal
distribution as a comparison. A distribution with high kurtosis is
said to be leptokurtic. It has wider, "fatter" tails and a
"sharper", more "peaked" center than a Normal distribution. In a
standard Normal distribution, the kurtosis is 3.  The term
"excess kurtosis" refers to the difference <code class="reqn">kurtosis - 3</code>.
Many researchers use the term kurtosis to refer to
"excess kurtosis" and this function follows suit.  The user may
set excess = FALSE, in which case the uncentered kurtosis is
returned.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">kurtosis(x, na.rm = TRUE, excess = TRUE, unbiased = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric variable (vector)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>na.rm</code></td>
<td>
<p>default TRUE. If na.rm = FALSE and there are missing
values, the mean and variance are undefined and this function
returns NA.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>excess</code></td>
<td>
<p>default TRUE. If true, function returns excess
kurtosis (kurtosis -3). If false, the return is simply
kurtosis as defined above.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>unbiased</code></td>
<td>
<p>default TRUE. Should the denominator of the
variance estimate be divided by N-1, rather than N?</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If kurtosis is smaller than 3 (or excess kurtosis is negative),
the tails are "thinner" than the normal distribution (there is
lower chance of extreme deviations around the mean). If kurtosis
is greater than 3 (excess kurtosis positive), then the tails are
fatter (observations can be spread more widely than in the Normal
distribution).
</p>
<p>The kurtosis may be calculated with the small-sample
bias-corrected estimate of the variance. Set unbiased = FALSE if
this is not desired.  It appears somewhat controversial whether
this is necessary. According to the
US NIST,
<a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35b.htm">http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35b.htm</a>,
kurtosis is defined as
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">kurtosis =  ( mean((x - mean(x))^4) )/ var(x)^2</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">var(x)</code> is calculated with the denominator <code class="reqn">N</code>,
rather than <code class="reqn">N-1</code>.
</p>
<p>A distribution is said to be leptokurtic if it is tightly bunched
in the center (spiked) and there are long tails. The long tails
reflect the probability of extreme values.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A scalar value or NA
