<h2>An Implementation of 'Interactive Brokers' API</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">rib</span> allows programs to interact with 'Interactive Brokers' (IB)
'Trader Workstation' (TWS).
It establishes a connection over the network and manages
the exchange of messages between client and server.
Data is encoded and decoded between user and wire formats
following closely the official implementations.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package design mirrors the implementations that
'Interactive Brokers' makes available for other languages,
such as C++, C#, Java and Python.
</p>
<p>The official IB documentation is therefore the most valuable reference regarding
the API functionality and usage.
