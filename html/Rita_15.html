<h2>Rita</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>R Exploratory Data Analysis (REDA; pronounced "rita")
summarizes an input dataset by the M, SD + 5-number summary + third and fourth moments
and visualizes the data according to an algorithm or as specified by the user.
In addition, Rita will provide the results of one or several normality tests.
Lastly, Rita normalizes the dataset with several methods and provides
visualizations of the best performing method to the user.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Rita(
  data,
  test = 1,
  xform = 1,
  alpha = 0.05,
  j = 1,
  autoPlot = T,
  histPlot = F,
  densPlot = F,
  stripPlot = F,
  violinPlot = F,
  xformPlot = F,
  return = T,
  seed = 10
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Input dataset (matrix, dataframe, or vector).
For a univariate distribution, submit a vector or a subsetted
matrix or dataframe. If results for many univariate distributions are
desired, submit a matrix or dataframe with each column representing a
given variable if all distributions are of the same sample-size. If not,
it is recommended to call Rita repeatedly for each variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>test</code></td>
<td>
<p>Desired normality test (scalar). By default (test = 1), Rita will
present the results of the Shapiro-wilk test to the user.
</p>
<p>test = 1: Shapiro-Wilk (SW)
</p>
<p>test = 2: Kolmogorov-Smirnov/Lilliefors (KSL)
</p>
<p>test = 3: Anderson-Darling (AD)
</p>
<p>test = 4: Jarque-Bera (JB)
</p>
<p>test = 5: D'Agostino Pearson Omnibus (DP)
</p>
<p>test = 6: Chi-square test (chiSq)
</p>
<p>test = 7: Results of all tests for the best performing transformation
</p>
<p>The order of the tests printed corresponds to the order of the variables stored within
the input dataset.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xform</code></td>
<td>
<p>Desired normalization method (scalar). By default (xform = 1), Rita
will assess which method performs best and (a.) return the transformed data to
the user, and (b.) visualize the data according to the settings of the plot argument.
</p>
<p>Please note that, per the recommendations of Osborne (2002), a constant is added
prior to logarithmic and inverse transformations to ensure that the minimum value
is anchored at 1, and prior to the square-root transformation to ensure a left anchor
of 0.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the arc-sine and logit transformations are applied after converting the units,
if needed, to ensure that variables are bounded between 0 and 1.
</p>
<p>The "best performing" method is identified by comparing goodness-of-fit to the
straight line of the QQ plot for the quantiles of the data normalized by a given method
and the standard normal distribution. If a tie is present between transformations for a
variable, one of the best performing transformations is arbitrarily selected.
</p>
<p>xform = 1: Best performing method is presented (excluding the Rankit)
</p>
<p>xform = 2: Logarithmic transform
</p>
<p>xform = 3: Inverse/reciprocal transform
</p>
<p>xform = 4: Square-root transform
</p>
<p>xform = 5: Arc-sine transform
</p>
<p>xform = 6: Logit transform
</p>
<p>xform = 7: Rankit transform</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>The two-sided decision threshold used for normality hypothesis-testing (scalar)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>j</code></td>
<td>
<p>The # hypotheses tested; used to compute a Bonferonni correction, if applicable;
should remain at its default if multiple testing is not an issue (scalar)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>autoPlot</code></td>
<td>
<p>Desired plotting method (boolean). By default (plot = 1),
the visualization will be implicitly chosen based on
extracted features of the dataset.
</p>
<p>When autoPlot = F, values of additional plotting arguments are used to
determine the visualizations provided to the user.
</p>
<p>When autoPlot = T:
</p>
<p>Histograms are always generated for discrete data.
</p>
<p>Density plots are always generated for continuous data.
</p>
<p>Strip plots are generated when the # distinct values
are &lt;= 20 AND the # datapoints are 15 &lt;= x &lt;= 150.
</p>
<p>Violin plots are instead generated in lieu of the strip plots
created when the above conditions are not met.
</p>
<p>Lastly, density plots for each (transformed*) variable are generated.
</p>
<p>*Transformed variables correspond to the choice made by the user for the xform argument
or to the best-performing transformation for each variable when xform = 1.
</p>
<p>All plots are drawn in the R console and saved as plotting objects.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Any rows with missing values (NAs) are removed for calculation purposes; if desired,
incomplete records should be imputed or removed with subsetting prior to calling Rita. 
In addition, note that any columns not numeric type or coercible to numeric are excluded 
from analysis, as are any numeric columns with 2 distinct values or less.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object containing the dataset of the best performing transformation for
each variable and the specified plots (list)
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">values &lt;- rnorm(100)
x &lt;- Rita(data = values)
