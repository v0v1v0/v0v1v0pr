<h2>Import capture-recapture data sets from space or tab-delimited files</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A relatively flexible function to import capture history data sets that
include a capture (encounter) history read in as a character string and an
arbitrary number of user specified covariates for the analysis.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">import.chdata(
  filename,
  header = TRUE,
  field.names = NULL,
  field.types = NULL,
  use.comments = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>filename</code></td>
<td>
<p>file name and path for file to be imported; fields in file
should be space or tab-delimited</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>header</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE/FALSE; if TRUE first line is name of variables</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>field.names</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of field names if header=FALSE; first field should
always be ch - capture history remaining number of fields and their names
are arbitrary</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>field.types</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector identifying whether fields (beyond ch) are numeric
("n") or factor ("f") or should be skipped ("s")</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>use.comments</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE values within /* and */ on data lines are used
as row.names for the RMark dataframe.  Only use this option if they are
unique values.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function was written both to be a useful tool to import data and as an
example for more specific import functions that a user may want to write for
data files that do not satisfy the requirements of this function.  In
particular this function will not handle files with fixed-width format files
that do not contain appropriate tab or space delimiters between the fields.
It also requires that the first field is the capture (encounter) history
which is named "ch" and is a character string.  The remaining fields are
arbitrary in number and type and are user defined based on the arguments to
the functions. Variables that will be used for grouping should be defined
with the <code>field.type="f"</code>. Numeric individual covariates (e.g., weight)
should be input as <code>field.type="n"</code>. Fields in the file that should not
be imported should be assigned <code>field.type="s"</code>.  The examples below
illustrate different uses of the calling arguments to import several
different data sets that meet the modest requirements of this function.
</p>
<p>If you specify a frequency for the encounter history, the field name must be
<code>freq</code>.  If you use any other name or spelling it will not be
recognized and the default frequency of 1 will be used for each encounter
history.  This function should not be used with files structured for input
into the MARK interface.  To use those types of files, see
<code>convert.inp</code>.  It is not neccessary to use either function to
create a dataframe for RMark.  All you need to is create a dataframe that
meets the specification of the RMark format.  For example, if you are
simulating data, you only need to create a dataframe with the fields ch,
freq (if differs from 1) and any covariates you want and then you can use
<code>process.data</code> on the dataframe.
</p>
<p>If you have comments in your data file, they should not have a column header
(field name in first row).  If <code>use.comments=TRUE</code> the comments are
used as row names of the data frame and they must be unique.  If
<code>use.comments=FALSE</code> and the file contains comments they are stripped
out.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dataframe for use in MARK analysis with obligate <code>ch</code>
character field representing the capture (encounter) history and optional
covariate/grouping variables.
