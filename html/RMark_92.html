<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These are simulated data for an imaginary situation with 35 independent
'sites' on which presence/absence of a breeding bird is recorded 3 times
annually for 3 years. Potential variables influencing site occupancy are
the size of the site in hectares (samplearea) and canopy cover percentage
(cover). The timing of the surveys within the year is thought to influence
the detection of occupancy, so the week the survey was conducted is included
in 9 variables that are named as occps where p is the primary session (year)
number and s is the secondary session (visit) number. Using
<code>data(RDOccupancy)</code> will retrieve the completed dataframe and using
<code>example(RDOccpancy)</code> will run the example code. However, in this
example we also show how to import the raw data and how they were modified
to construct the <code>RDOccupancy</code> dataframe.
</p>
<p>For this example, the raw data are shown below and the code below assumes
the file is named <code>RD_example.txt</code>.

<p>The data could be read into a dataframe with code as follows:
</p>
<pre>RDOccupancy&lt;-read.table("RD_example.txt",
colClasses=c("character", rep("numeric",2), rep("character", 9)),
header=TRUE)</pre>
<p>Note that if the file was not in the same working directory as your
workspace (.RData) then you can set the working directory to the directory
containing the file by using the following command before the
<code>read.table</code>.
</p>
<p><code>setwd(your working directory location here)</code>
</p>
<p>In the data file "." represents a site that was not visited on an occasion.
Those "." values are read in fine because <code>ch</code> is read in as a
character string. However, "." has also been used in the file in place of
numeric values of the <code>occ</code> variable. Because "." is not numeric, R
will coerce the input value to an NA value for each "." and will treat
the column they are in as a factor.  Thus, the "NA" will not be a
valid numeric value for MARK, so we need to change it to a number. To avoid
the coercion, the <code>occ</code> values were read in as characters and the
following code changes all "." to "0" and then coverts the fields to numeric
values:
</p>
<pre> for (i in 4:12) { RDOccupancy[RDOccupancy[,i]==".",i]="0"
RDOccupancy[,i]=as.numeric(RDOccupancy[,i]) } </pre>
<p>It is fine to use zero (or any numeric value) in place of missing values for
session-dependent covariates as the "0's" provide no information for
modeling as they are tied to un-sampled occasions. However, all values of a
site-specific covariate (e.g., cover) are used, so there cannot be any
missing values.  Note, however that use of "0's" in the time-dependent covariates
will influence predictions output by MARK for that parameter, as they will be 
biased low due to the zero's being included in estimating the mean for that 
parameter.
</p>
<p>The code below and associated comments provide a self contained example for
importing, setting up, and evaluating the any of the general robust design
type models (RDOccupEG, RDOccupPE, RDOccupPG) using RMARK. Unlike standard
occupancy designs, robust designs require the user to designate primary and
secondary occasions using the argument <code>time.intervals</code>. For this
example, we have 3 primary occasions (year) with 3 secondary sampling
occasions within each year, thus, we would set our <code>time.intervals</code> as
follows to represent 0 interval between secondary occasions and interval of
1 (years in this case) between primary occasions:
</p>
<pre> time.intervals=c(0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0) </pre>
<p>The first 0 designates the interval between the first and second sampling
occasion in year 1, the second 0 designates the interval between the second
and third sampling occasion in year 1, and the 1 indicated the change from
primary period 1 to primary period 2. See <code>process.data</code> for
more information on the use of <code>time.intervals</code>.
