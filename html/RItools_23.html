<h2>ModelMatrixPlus S4 class</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>If the Covariates matrix has an intercept, it will only be in the first column.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>More on NotMissing slot: It's matrix of numbers in [0,1].
First col is entirely <code>TRUE</code> or 1, like an intercept, unless corresponding
UnitWeight is 0, in which case it may also be 0 (see below). Subsequent cols
present only if there are missing covariate values, in which case these cols are
named for terms (of the original calling formula or data frame) that possess
missing values.  Terms with the same missing data pattern are mapped to a single
column of this matrix.  If the ModelMatrixPlus is representing elements, each column should
be all 1s and 0s, indicating which elements have non-missing values for the term
represented by that column.  If the ModelMatrixPlus as a whole represents clusters,
then there can be fractional values, but that situation should only arise in the
DesignOptions class exension of this class, so it's documented there.
