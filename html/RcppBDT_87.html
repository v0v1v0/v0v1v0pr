<h2>Parse POSIXct objects from input data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function uses the Boost Date_Time library to parse 
datetimes (and dates) from strings, integers or even numeric values
(which are cast to strings internall). It returns a vector of
<code>POSIXct</code> objects. These represent dates and time as (possibly
fractional) seconds since the ‘epoch’ of January 1, 1970. 
A timezone can be set, if none is supplied ‘UTC’ is set.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">toPOSIXct(x, tz = "UTC")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of type character, integer or numeric with 
date(time) expressions to be parsed and converted.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tz</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string with the timezone, defaults to ‘UTC’ if unset</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A number of fixed formats are tried in succession. These include
the standard ISO format ‘YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS’ as well as
different local variants including several forms popular in the 
United States.  Two-digits years and clearly ambigous formats such
as ‘03/04/05’ are ignored.  In the case of parsing failure
a <code>NA</code> value is returned.
</p>
<p>Fractional seconds are supported as well.  As R itself only supports 
microseconds, the Boost compile-time option for nano-second resolution 
has not been enabled.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of ‘POSIXct’ elements.
