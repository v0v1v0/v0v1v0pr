<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Curves represent the density of the minimum (oldest dates) and the maximum (youngest dates) of the dates included in each phase. Curves of the same color refer to the same phase. Time range intervals are symbolised by segments above the curves drawn using the same color as the one of the curves of the associated phase. Transition and gap range intervals are represented by two-coloured segments using the colors of the both phases in succession. If the gap between the successive phases does not exist, a cross is drawn instead of a segment.
