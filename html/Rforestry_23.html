<h2>predictInfo-forestry</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Get the observations which are used to predict for a set of new
observations using either all trees (for out of sample observations), or
tree for which the observation is out of averaging set or out of sample entirely.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">predictInfo(object, newdata, aggregation = "average")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>A 'forestry' object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>newdata</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data on which we want to do predictions. Must be the same length
as the training set if we are doing 'oob' or 'doubleOOB' aggregation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>aggregation</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies which aggregation version is used to predict for the
observation, must be one of 'average','oob', and 'doubleOOB'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with four entries. 'weightMatrix' is a matrix specifying the
weight given to training observatio i when prediction on observation j.
'avgIndices' gives the indices which are in the averaging set for each new
observation. 'avgWeights' gives the weights corresponding to each averaging
observation returned in 'avgIndices'. 'obsInfo' gives the full observation vectors
which were used to predict for an observation, as well as the weight given
each observation.
