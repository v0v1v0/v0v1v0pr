<h3>Description</h3>

<p>”This radar data was collected by a system in Goose Bay, Labrador.  This
system consists of a phased array of 16 high-frequency antennas with a
total transmitted power on the order of 6.4 kilowatts.  The targets
were free electrons in the ionosphere.
"good" radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure
in the ionosphere.  "bad" returns are those that do not; their signals pass
through the ionosphere.
Received signals were processed using an autocorrelation function whose
arguments are the time of a pulse and the pulse number.  There were 17
described by 2 attributes per pulse number, corresponding to the complex
values returned by the function resulting from the complex electromagnetic
signal.” [UCI archive]

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(ionosphere)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 351 rows and 33 variables: 32 measurements and one
(the last, <code>Class</code>) grouping variable: 225 <code>'good'</code> and 126 <code>'bad'</code>.
</p>
<p>The original dataset at UCI contains 351 rows and 35 columns. The first 34
columns are features, the last column contains the classification label of
'g' and 'b'. The first feature is binary and the second one is only 0s,
one grouping variable - factor with labels 'good' and 'bad'.

<p>This data set, with the original 34 features is available in the package <span class="pkg">mlbench</span>
and a different data set (refering to the same UCI repository) is available in
the package <code>dprep</code> (archived on CRAN).
