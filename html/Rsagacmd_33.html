<h2>Automatic search for the path to a SAGA-GIS installation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns the path to the saga_cmd executable.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">search_saga()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>On Microsoft Windows, automatic searching will occur first in 'C:/Program
Files/SAGA-GIS'; 'C:/Program Files (x86)/SAGA-GIS'; 'C:/SAGA-GIS';
'C:/OSGeo4W'; and 'C:/OSGeo4W64'.
</p>
<p>On Linux, saga_cmd is usually included in PATH, if not an automatic search is
performed in the '/usr/' folder.
</p>
<p>For macOS, since version 8.5, SAGA-GIS is available as an standalone macOS
app from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/">SourceForge</a>. The
'SAGA.app' package is searched first (assuming that it is installed in the
'/Applications/' folder). Other macOS locations that are searched include
'/usr/local/bin/' (for Homebrew installations) and within the QGIS application
(SAGA-GIS is bundled with the QGIS application on macOS by default).
</p>
<p>If multiple versions of SAGA-GIS are installed on the system, the path to the
newest version is returned.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The path to installed saga_cmd binary.
</p>
