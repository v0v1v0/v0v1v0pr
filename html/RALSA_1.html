<h2>R Analyzer for Large-Scale Assessments (RALSA)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The RALSA package provides functionality for analyzing data from large-scale assessments and surveys which use complex sampling and assessment design. Such (international) assessments and surveys are TIMSS, PIRLS and PISA, for example.
</p>
<p>The sampling (complex sampling design) in large-scale assessments and surveys is multistage with probability proportional to the size of the (primary) sampling units (usually schools), i.e. with unequal probabilities of selection. Thus, all weights assigned to the individual respondents reflect these unequal probabilities. This is quite different from the usual simple or systematic random sampling. Different modifications of Jackknife Repeated Replication (JRR, with full or half replication) or Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR) are used in different studies to compute the standard errors of the population estimates. The proficiency test scores (complex assessment design) is applied to cope with practical issues. No respondent takes all test items, but the items are distributed across multiple test item blocks and the blocks are rotated across multiple assessment booklets, each respondent taking one booklet only. As a consequence, no respondent receives a single test score, but five (or even 10) separate test scores (called "plausible values" or PVs) resulting from multiple imputation technique where the missing by design responses are imputed. As a consequence of the complex sampling and assessment designs, each estimate has to be computed with each JRR or BRR weight and each PV (this can take up to 781 computations per estimate per group per country, depending on the study), then summarized to compute the final estimate, its sampling and imputation variance, and the final standard error.
</p>
<p>RALSA provides data preparation and analysis functions which take into account the complex sampling and assessment design of the studies. Each study has its a different implementation of the complex sampling and assessment designs and RALSA handles these and implements the corresponding computational procedure.
</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>Currently, RALSA provides the following functionality:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Data preparation functions - prepare data for analysis
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>lsa.convert.data</code> The studies provide their data in SPSS and SAS format. In addition, PISA cycles prior to 2015 provide the data in <code>.TXT</code> format, along with their SPSS and SAS import syntax files. This function takes the originally provided SPSS data (or <code>.TXT</code>, along with the import syntaxes) files and converts them into native <code>.RData</code> files. It also adds variable labels, user-defined missing codes (if requested) and identifiers of the study, cycle, and respondent types (i.e. student, parent, teacher, school principal).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>lsa.select.countries.PISA</code> Utility function to select countries' data from a converted PISA file and save them as a new file or assign them to an object in memory. This makes it more convenient to work with PISA data files which contain data from all countries per respondent type.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>lsa.merge.data</code> The studies provide data from different respondents (i.e. student, parent, teacher, school principal) which are sampled hierarchically (e.g. students are nested in classes, classes are nested in schools and taught by teachers) and linked between each other. The files in the databases are provided separately per country and respondent type. This function merges data sets from different respondents and/or countries assuring the links between the different types of respondents (i.e. linking students only to principals' data only for their school and to the teachers who teach them). This function merges data for all studies, except for PISA where the structure of the files does not allow (for now) merging data from different respondent types.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>lsa.vars.dict</code> Prints and/or saves variable dictionaries in a file. Convenient when need to know the structure of the variables of interest.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>lsa.data.diag</code> Helper function for quick frequency (for categorical variables) and descriptive (continuous variables) tables (weighted or unweighted). These can serve for initial exploration of the data and elaborating hypotheses. Not intended for actual analysis.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>lsa.recode.vars</code> Recodes variables from large-scale assessments taking care of the user-defined missing values. Convenient for collapsing categories or changing their order.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p> Analysis functions - estimates are on population level, taking into account the complex sampling and assessment design
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>lsa.pcts.means</code> Computes percentages of respondents and means (arithmetic average, median or mode) for continuous variables within groups
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>lsa.prctls</code> Computes percentiles of continuous variables within groups
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>lsa.bench</code> Computes percentages of respondents reaching or surpassing benchmarks of achievement
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>lsa.crosstabs</code> Crosstabulations with Rao-Scott first- and second-order chi-square adjustments
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>lsa.corr</code> Computes correlations between variables (Pearson or Spearman)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>lsa.lin.reg</code> Computes linear regression with or without contrast coding of categorical variables
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>lsa.bin.log.reg</code> Computes binary logistic regression with or without contrast coding of categorical variables
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>lsa.pcts.means</code>, <code>lsa.prctls</code>, <code>lsa.bench</code> and <code>lsa.crosstabs</code> also have the option to produce graphs from the estimates.
</p>
<p>More studies and analysis types will be added in future, and the existing ones will be updated, adding more features.
</p>
<p>RALSA also has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the less technical users. The GUI incorporates all aspects of the data preparation and analysis functions.
