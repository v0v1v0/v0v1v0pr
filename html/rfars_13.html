<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This codebook serves as a useful reference for researchers using FARS data.
The 'source' variable is intended to help combine with the gescrss_codebook.
Data elements are relatively stable but are occasionally discontinued, created anew,
or modified. The 'year' variable helps indicate the availability of data elements,
and differentiates between different definitions over time. Users should always
check for discontinuities when tabulating cases.
</p>
<p>The 'file' variable indicates the file in which the given data element originally appeared. Here, files refers to
the SAS files downloaded from NHTSA. Most data elements stayed in their original
file. Those that did not were moved to the multi_ files. For example, 'weather'
originates from the 'accident' file, but appears in the multi_acc data object
created by rfars.
</p>
<p>The 'name_ncsa' variable describes the data element's name as assigned
by NCSA (the organization within NHTSA that manages the database). To maximize
compatibility between years and ease of use for programming, 'name_rfars'
provides a cleaned naming convention (via janitor::clean_names()). Both
names are provided here to help users find the corresponding entry in
the <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813254">Analytical User’s Manual</a>
but only the latter are used in the data produced by get_fars().
</p>
<p>Each data element has a 'label', a more human-readable version of the
element names. For example, the label for 'road_fnc' is 'Roadway Function Class'.
These are not definitions but may provide enough information to help users
conduct their analysis. Consult the <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813254">Analytical User’s Manual</a>
for definitions and further details.
</p>
<p>Each data element has multiple 'value'-'value_label' pairs: 'value' represents
the original, non-human-readable value (usually a number), and 'value_label'
represents the corresponding text value. For example, for 'road_fnc', 1 (the 'value')
corresponds to 'Rural-Principal Arterial-Interstate' (the 'value_label'), 2 corresponds to
'Rural-Principal Arterial-Other', etc.
