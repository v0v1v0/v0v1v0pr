<h2>
Sweave Drivers with Extra Tricks Up their Sleeve
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Weave and tangle drivers for Sweave extending the
  standard drivers. RweaveExtraLatex and RtangleExtra provide options
  to completely ignore code chunks on weaving, tangling, or both.
  Chunks ignored on weaving are not parsed, yet are written out
  verbatim on tangling. Chunks ignored on tangling may be evaluated as
  usual on weaving, but are completely left out of the tangled
  scripts. The driver RtangleExtra also provides an option to specify
  the extension of the file name (or remove it entirely) when
  splitting is selected on tangling.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>RweaveExtraLatex</code> and <code>RtangleExtra</code>
drivers extend the standard <code>Sweave</code> drivers
<code>RweaveLatex</code> and
<code>Rtangle</code>, respectively. They are selected
through the <code>driver</code> argument of <code>Sweave</code>.
</p>
<p>The drivers provide additional options to completely ignore code
chunks on weaving, tangling, or both. Chunks ignored on weaving are
not parsed and are written out verbatim on tangling. Chunks ignored on
tangling are processed as usual on weaving, but completely left out of
the tangled scripts. The driver <code>RtangleExtra</code> also
provides the option <code>extension</code> to specify the extension of the
file name (or remove it entirely) when splitting is selected.
</p>
<p>In a literate programming workflow, the additional options allow
to include code chunks in a file such as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>code that is not parsable by R (say, because of errors
inserted for educational purposes);
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>code in another programming language entirely (say, a shell
script to start an analysis);
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>code for a Shiny app.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With the standard drivers, using option <code>eval = FALSE</code> results in
code being commented out in tangled scripts files. Chunks may be
omitted on tangling with <code>drop.evalFALSE = TRUE</code>, but only
provided the chunk is not evaluated on weaving. Therefore, the
standard drivers have no provision to either omit a chunk on weaving
and tangle it as is, or to process a chunk on weaving but omit it
on tangling.
