<h2>
A Simple Wrapper to the CCTZ Library for Time Zone Calculations
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>CCTZ contains two underlying libraries which build on the C++11
library <code>chrono</code>.  The first covers <em>civil time</em> for
computing with human-scale time such as dates and time. It is
header-only. The second covers time zones and allow translation
between absolute time and civil time.
</p>
<p>RcppCCTZ brings CCTZ to R by means of Rcpp.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>CCTZ requires a valid timezone library as well as recent-enough
compiler to cope with C++11.
</p>
<p>Windows is supported since version 0.2.0 via the <code>g++-4.9</code>
compiler, but note that it provides an <em>incomplete</em> C++11
library. The <code>std::get_time</code> function was ported from libc++ of
the LLVM to enable this. However, string formatting is more limited as
the libc++ library used by <code>g++-4.9</code> does not provide complete
C++11 semantics. As one example, CCTZ frequently uses <code>"%F %T"</code>
which do not work on Windows; one has to use
<code>"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Author(s)</h3>

<p>Dirk Eddelbuettel wrote the package; Dan Dillon ported <code>std::get_time</code>
from LLVM's libc++; Bradley White and Greg Miller wrote the underlying CCTZ library.
