The Non-Parametric Density Test of Hong and Li
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements the Non-Parametric Density Test of Hong and Li. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">HLTest(PIT, lags = 4, kernel = "quartic", conf.level = 0.95)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>PIT</code></td>
<td>

<p>This represents the actual data transformed into a U(0,1) series by applying the
distribution function of the estimated model conditional on the parameters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lags</code></td>
<td>

<p>The number of lags to use for testing the joint hypothesis.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>kernel</code></td>
<td>

<p>The kernel to use for the comparison against the PIT series (only the 
‘quartic’ currently implemented).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>conf.level</code></td>
<td>

<p>The confidence level at which the Null Hypothesis is evaluated.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A novel method to analyze how well a conditional density fits the underlying 
data is through the probability integral transformation (PIT) discussed in 
Rosenblatt (1952) and used in the <code>BerkowitzTest</code>. 
More recently, Hong and Li (2005) introduced a nonparametric portmanteau test, 
building on the work of Ait-Sahalia (1996), which tests the joint hypothesis of 
i.i.d and uniformity for a series of PIT transformed data. To achieve this, it 
tests for misspecification in the conditional moments of the model transformed 
standardized residuals, and is distributed as N(0, 1) under the Null of 
a correctly specified model. These moment tests are reported as ‘M(1,1)’ 
to ‘M(4,4)’ in the output, with ‘M(1,2)’ related to ARCH-in-mean
effects, and ‘M(2,1)’ to leverage, while ‘W’ is the Portmanteu type 
test statistic for general misspecification (using p lags) and also distributed 
as N(0, 1) under the Null of a correctly specified model. Only upper tail critical 
values are used in this test. The interested reader is referred to the paper 
for more details.
