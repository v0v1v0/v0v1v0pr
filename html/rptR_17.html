<h2>rptR: Repeatability Estimation for Gaussian and Non-Gaussian data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A collection of functions for calculating point estimates, interval estimates and 
significance tests of the repeatability (intra-class correlation coefficient) as well as 
variance components in mixed effects models. The function rpt is a wrapper function 
that calls more specialised functions as required. Specialised functions can also be called 
directly (see rpt for details). All
functions return lists of values in the form of an S3 object <code>rpt</code>. The function summary.rpt produces summaries in a
detailed format and plot.rpt plots bootstraps or permutation results.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Currently there four different functions depending on the distribution and type of response: (1)
rptGaussian for a Gaussian response distributions, (2) rptPoisson for Poisson-distributed data, 
(3) rptBinary for binary response following binomial distributions and (4) rptProportion for
response matrices with a column for successes and a column for failures that are analysed as proportions
following binomial distributions. All function use a mixed model framework in <code>lme4</code>, 
and the non-Gaussian functions use an observational level random effect to account
for overdispersion.
</p>
<p>All functions use the argument <code>formula</code>, which is the same formula interface as in the
<code>lme4</code> package (indeed models are fitted by <code>lmer</code> or <code>glmer</code>). Repeatabilites are 
calculated for the response variable, while one or
more grouping factors of interest can be assigned as random effects in the form (1|group) and
have to be specified with the <code>grname</code> argument. This allows to estimate adjusted
repeatabilities (controlling for fixed effects) and the estimation of multiple variance 
components simultaneously (multiple random effects). All variables have to be columns 
in a <code>data.frame</code> given in the <code>data</code> argument. The <code>link</code> argument specifies
the link function for a given non-Gaussian distribtion. 
</p>
<p>The argument <code>ratio</code> allows switching to raw variances rather than ratios of variances 
to be estimated and The argument <code>adjusted</code> allows switching to an estimation where the 
variance explained by fixed effects is included in the denominator of the repeatability 
calculation. The reserved <code>grname</code> terms "Residual", "Overdispersion" and "Fixed" allow 
the estimation of oversipersion variance, residual variance and variance explained by 
fixed effects, respectively. All computation can be parallelized with the <code>parallel</code> 
argument, which enhances computation speed for larger computations.
