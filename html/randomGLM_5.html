<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function <code>randomGLM</code> can be used to predict a variety of different types of outcomes. The outcome
type is specified by the argument <code>type</code> as follows:
</p>
<p>If <code>type = "auto"</code>, the function will attempt to determine the response type automatically. If the response
is not a <code>Surv</code> object and is a factor or has 3 or fewer unique values, 
it is assumed to be categorical. If the number of unique values is 2, the function uses logistic regression;
for categorical responses with more 3 or more possible values, see below.
</p>
<p>If <code>type = "linear"</code>, the responses is assumed to be numeric with Gaussian errors, and the function
will use linear regression.
</p>
<p>If <code>type = "binary"</code>, the response is assumed to be categorical (at this point not necessarily binary
but that may change in the future). If the response has 2 levels, logistic regression (binomial family with
the logit link) is used. If the response has more than 2 levels, see below.
</p>
<p>If <code>type = "count"</code>, the response is assumed to represent counts with Poisson-distributed errors, and
Poisson regression (poisson family with the logarithmic link) is used.
</p>
<p>If <code>type = "general"</code>, the function does not make assumption about the response type and the user must
specify an appropriate family (see <code>stats{family}</code>).
</p>
<p>If <code>type = "survival"</code>, the function assumes the response is a censored time, that is a
<code>Surv</code> object. In this case the argument <code>family</code> must be <code>NULL</code> (the
default) and the function uses Cox proportional hazard regression implemented in function
<code>coxph</code>
</p>
<p>The function proceeds along the following steps:
</p>
<p>Step 1 (bagging): <code>nBags</code> bootstrapped data sets are being generated based on random sampling from the
original training data set (<code>x</code>,<code>y</code>). If a bag contains less than <code>minInBagObs</code> unique
observations or it contains all observations, it is discarded and re-sampled again.
</p>
<p>Step 2 (random subspace): For each bag, <code>nFeaturesInBag</code> features are randomly selected (without
replacement) from the columns of <code>x</code>. Optionally, interaction terms between the selected features can
be formed (see the argument <code>maxInteractionOrder</code>). 
</p>
<p>Step 3 (feature ranking): In each bag, features are ranked according to their correlation with the outcome
measure. Next the top <code>nCandidateCovariates</code> are being considered for forward selection in each GLM
(and in each bag).  
</p>
<p>Step 4 (forward selection): Forward variable selection is employed to define a multivariate GLM model of the
outcome in each bag. 
</p>
<p>Step 5 (aggregating the predictions): Prediction from each bag are aggregated. In case, of a quantitative
outcome, the predictions are simply averaged across the bags. 
</p>
<p>Generally, <code>nCandidateCovariates</code>&gt;100 is not recommended, because the forward
selection process is 
time-consuming. If arguments <code>"nBags=1, replace=FALSE, nObsInBag=nrow(x)"</code> are used, 
the function becomes a forward selection GLM predictor without bagging. 
</p>
<p>Classification of multi-level categorical responses is performed indirectly by turning the single
multi-class response into a set of binary variables. The set can include two types of binary variables:
Level vs. all others (this binary variable is 1 when the original response equals the level and zero
otherwise), and level A vs. level B (this binary variable is 0 when the response equals level A, 1 when the
response equals level B, and NA otherwise). 
For example, if the input response <code>y</code> contains observations with values (levels) "A", "B", 
"C", the binary variables
will have names "all.vs.A" (1 means "A", 0 means all others), "all.vs.B",
"all.vs.C", and optionally also "A.vs.B" (0 means "A", 1 means "B", NA means neither "A" nor "B"), "A.vs.C",  
and "B.vs.C". 
Note that using pairwise level vs. level binary variables be
very time-consuming since the number of such binary variables grows quadratically with the number of levels
in the response. The user has the option to limit which levels of the original response will have their
"own" binary variables, by setting the minimum observations a level must have to qualify for its own binary
variable, and by explicitly enumerating levels that should not have their own binary variables. Note that
such "ignored" levels are still included on the "all" side of "level vs. all" binary variables. 
</p>
<p>At this time the predictor does not attempt to summarize the binary variable classifications into a single
multi-level classification. 
</p>
<p>Training this predictor on data with fewer than 8 observations is not recommended (and the
function will warn about it). Due to the bagging
step, the number of unique observations in each bag is less than the number of observations in the input
data; the low number of unique observations can (and often will) lead to an essentially perfect fit which
makes it impossible to perfrom meaningful stepwise model selection.  
</p>
<p>Feature names: In general, the column names of input <code>x</code> are assumed to be the feature names. If
<code>x</code> has no column names (i.e., <code>colnames(x)</code> is <code>NULL</code>), stadard column names of the form
<code>"F01", "F02", ...</code> are used. If <code>x</code> has non-NULL column names, they are turned into valid and
unique names using the function <code>make.names</code>. If the function <code>make.names</code> returns
names that are not the same as the column names of <code>x</code>, the component <code>featureNamesChanged</code> will
be <code>TRUE</code> and the component <code>nameTranslationTable</code> contains the information about input and actual
used feature names. The feature names are used as predictor names in the individual models in each bag.
