<h2>BeetlesMale dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>BeetlesMale dataset
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is an simulated dataset which was used as a toy example for a different purpose 
(Nakagawa &amp; Schielzeth 2013). 
It offers a balanced dataset with rather simple structure, sizable effects and decent sample size, 
just right for demonstrating some features of <code>rptR</code>. 
Sufficient sample size is required in particular for the non-Gaussian traits, 
because those tend to be more computationally demanding and less rich in information per data 
point than simple Gaussian traits.
</p>
<p>In brief the imaginary sampling design of the simulated dataset is as follows. 
Beetle larvae were sampled from 12 populations ('Population') with samples taken from two 
discrete microhabitats at each location ('Habitat'). Samples were split in equal proportion 
and raised in two dietary treatments ('Treatment'). Beetles were sexed at the pupal stage ('Sex') 
and pupae were kept in sex-homogeneous containers ('Container'). 
The phenotype in this dataset is a binary variable containing the two distinct color 
morphs of males: dark and reddish-brown ('Colour').
