<h2>Initialise individuals and simulate farming</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Initialises a new set of individuals and then simulates farming over time.
This is the main function that runs individual-based simulations of crop and
pesticide use and the evolution of pesticide resistance over time. To run 
this function, output from the mine_gmatrix function is required to specify
the covariance structure of individual traits and individual genomes. The
arguments to this function are used to initialise a landscape with the 
make_landscape function and initialise individuals with the initialise_inds
function. After initialisation, the simulation continues for up to a set 
number of time steps (unless extinction occurs), and individuals on the
landscape feed, encounter pesticide, move, reproduce, and die depending upon
the arguments specified in this function. After a specified number of time
steps, the crop or pesticide applied to a landscape cell can also change. The
end result is an evolving population of individuals that express traits 
that can potentially affect fitness (e.g., food consumption, pesticide
consumption, movement). Population level statistics are calculated by 
default and printed to a CSV, but individual level data (which includes all 
individual characteristics in a large table) need to be turned on because 
files can become extremely large (use print_inds with extreme caution and
print_last with care).

<td><code>mortality_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>This determines how mortality is enacted in the 
simulation. Currently there is only one mortality type possible; mortality 
occurs if individuals exceed their maximum age, do not consume enough food, 
or consume too much pesticide.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<p>This is the age at which mortality associated with

<td><code>farms</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the number of farms to be placed on the landscape. Farms

pesticides they apply.</p>

homologous loci. This only applies for diploid genomes.</p>

<p>This determines how mutation is modelled. If 0, then a 
completely new allele value is drawn from a normal distribution with a mean 
of mutation_direction and a standard deviation of 1 (or 1 / sqrt(2) for 
diploids, so that the expected standard devation of the sum of both allele 
values is 1). If 1, then a new value is drawn from a normal distribution with
mean mutation_direction and standard deviation of 1, and this new value is 
then added to the existing allele value.</p>

0, then only loci values (green circles in Figure 1) can mutate. If 1, then 
loci and the first column of arrows (green circles to first column of blue 
squares in Figure 1) can mutate. If 2, then the first two columns of arrows 
in Figure 1 can mutate, and so forth. Fewer mutation layers will constrain 
the covariance among traits, while more mutation layers will allow the 
covariance structure to evolve more readily.</p>

<td>
<p>The direction along the network in which net_mu_layers 
applies (not loci, green circles in Figure 1, can always mutate). If 1, then 
net_mu_layers applies in the direction from loci to traits. If 0, then the 
direction applies from traits to loci (i.e., net_mu_dir = 0 and 
net_mu_layers = 1 would mean that only the arrow values between the last 
hidden layer and traits in Figure 1 could mutate).</p>

<td>
<p>Initial crop type for each farm. This can be set in one of 
two ways. First, the default value "random" will randomly assign each farm to
an initial crop to produce. Second, a vector can be used to specify the crop
initialised on each farm. The vector must be the same length as the number of
farms, and the value of each element 'i' of the vector defines which crop is
initialised for each farm i. Hence, a crop_init vector must have as many
elements as there are farms, and vector elements must include natural numbers
from 1 to the total number of crops.</p>

<td><code>crop_rotation_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>This determines how crop types are rotated across 
the landscape. This can be set in one of two ways. First, a natural number

will be randomly chosen every crop_rotation_time time steps for each farm, 
or (3) farms will cycle through crop types in order, with a change from one
crop type to another every crop_rotation_time time step. Second, a square 
matrix can specify the probability of transition from a focal crop type 
(rows) to the next crop type (columns). Matrix rows must therefore sum to 1. 
For example, an identity matrix (1s in the diagonal and 0s in the 
off-diagonal) would specify crops that never rotate (i.e., crop i always 
rotates to itself).</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>crop_rotation_time</code></td>
<td>
<p>This determines how many time steps a crop is left 
before being refreshed and potentially changed. Note that even if the crop 
type does not change, this value still has the effect of determining how 
often crops are replenished (if some have been eaten since the last time they
were replenished).</p>

be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Beyond this requirement, there is no restriction on where 
different farms are placed; the do not even need to be contiguous on the 
landscape. Note that a custom terrain will override the arguments farms, 
xdim, and ydim. For example, if the matrix given to the terrain argument has
10 rows and 10 columns, then the simulation will automatically set xdim and
ydim equal to 10 without any warnings. Also note that these terrain values do
not necessarily need to be farms. Through the use of a custom landscape and 
pesticide rotation option, these cells could represent something like 
diversionary feeding sites or even buildings or rivers. See vignettes and

<p>This provides the mean values of the evolving pest traits

mean trait values in the initialised population, the trait_means argument
requires a vector of the same length as the number of evolving pest traits
defined within the function (i.e., if there are two evolving traits in the
simulation, "T1" and "T2", then trait_means should be a vector of length 2).

model the increase in biomass caused by plant growth on the landscape cell.
The way in which growth is enacted is set by crop_growth_type. Values for
crop_growth can either be a single number (in which case, the growth amount
applies to all crop types) or a vector of the same length as crop_types (in
which case, vector indices give the amount of growth for each crop number).</p>

<p>This clarifies whether crop growth should be 
"none" (default), "geometric", or "linear". If geometric, then the value of a
landscape cell increases to cell_value * (1 + crop_growth). If linear, then
a fixed value crop_growth is added to the existing cell value. Note that for
linear growth, this fixed value is only added if the existing cell value is
greater than zero (else it is assumed that there is no crop to grow).</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The output in the R console is a list with two elements; the first 
element is a vector of parameter values used by the model, and the second 
element is the landscape in the simulation. The most relevant output will be
produced as CSV files within the working directory. When get_stats = TRUE, 
a file named 'population_data.csv' is produced in the working directory. When
print_last = TRUE, a complete array of all individuals and their 
characteristics is printed for the last time step in the working directory in
a file named 'last_time_step.csv' (for large simulations, this file can be 
&gt; 1GB in size). When print_inds = TRUE, a complete array of all individuals 
in all time steps is produced in the working directory in a file named
'individuals.csv' (use this option with extreme caution for all but the
smallest simulations).
