<h2>Select Constrained Univariate Distribution Functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Selection of distribution functions for continuous raster layers that were
used to create a raster layer of classification units. The distribution
functions currently supported are the probability density function (PDF), the
empirical cumulative density function (ECDF), and the inverse of the
empirical cumulative density function (iECDF). Please note that
<code>select_functions</code> DOES NOT calculate the aforementioned
distribution functions. The sole purpose of <code>select_functions</code> is
to assist in the knowledge-driven selection of the most appropriate
distribution function for each continuous variable used to create a given
classification unit (see <strong>Details</strong>).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">select_functions(
  cu.rast,
  var.rast,
  fun = mean,
  varscale = "uniminmax",
  mode = "auto",
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cu.rast</code></td>
<td>
<p>SpatRaster, as in <code>rast</code>. Single-layer
SpatRaster representing the classification units occurring across
geographic space. The cell values (i.e., numeric IDs) for classification
units must be integer values.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<td><code>mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character. String specifying the selection mode for univariate
distribution functions. Possible values are "inter" for interactive

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The selection of distribution functions is univariate, that is, for each
variable, and it is constrained, meaning that the selection has to be made
for each classification unit. Overall, the distribution functions are used to
characterize typical values of a given continuous variable within a given
classification unit. When the PDF is selected, values closer to, or at the
peak of the PDF will be considered as the most typical. Contrarily, values at
the tails of the PDF will be considered as the less typical. When the ECDF or
the iECDF are selected, values toward (+)infinity and (-)infinity will be
considered as the most typical values, respectively.
</p>
<p>In order to assist the selection process, when <em>mode = "inter"</em>, this
function displays an interactive parallel coordinates plot (see
<code>ggplotly</code>) and a writable table (built in Shiny). For
each variable, the parallel coordinates plot shows a trend of a descriptive
statistical measurement (argument <em>fun</em>) across all of the
classification units. Using this trend, one can then select the most
appropriate distribution function for each variable based on the
occurrence/absence of <strong>"peaks"</strong> and <strong>"pits"</strong> in the observed
trend. For instance, a peak (highest point in the trend) would indicate that
the given classification unit contains on average, the highest values of that
variable. Conversely, a pit (lowest point in the trend) would indicate that
the given classification unit contains on average, the lowest values of that
variable. Thus, an ECDF and an iECDF can be selected for the peak and the
pit, respectively. The PDF can be selected for classification units whose
trend does not show either a peak or a pit. Please consider that peaks and
pits are only reference points and thus, one should validate the selection of
distribution functions based on domain knowledge.
</p>
<p>When <em>mode = "auto"</em>, the criteria for the selection of distribution
functions will be based on peaks and pits in the parallel coordinates plot.
</p>
<p>The output table (<strong>distfun</strong>) is intended to be used as input in the
<code>predict_functions</code> function.
</p>
<p>The selection of distribution functions is similar to the selection of
membership functions in fuzzy logic. For example, if one wants to describe a
phenomenon through distribution functions of continuous variables, then the
functions can be considered to be membership curves. Accordingly, the PDF,
ECDF, and iECDF will be equivalent to the Gaussian, S, and Z membership
functions, respectively.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <em>mode = "inter"</em>:
</p>
<p><strong>distfun</strong>: A DT table (DataTables library) with the following
attributes: (1) <em>Class.Unit</em> = numeric ID for classification units, (2)
<em>Variable</em> = each of the <em>n</em> continuous raster layers of a
classification unit, and (3) <em>Dist.Func</em> = Empty column whose cells can
be filled with the following strings: "PDF, "ECDF", and "iECDF" (unquoted).
This table can be saved on disk through the Shiny interface.
</p>
<p><strong>parcoord</strong>: A plotly-based parallel coordinate plot which can be saved
on disk using the R package htmlwidgets.
</p>
<p>If <em>mode = "auto"</em>:
</p>
<p><strong>distfun</strong>: Same as <strong>distfun</strong> when <em>mode = "inter"</em>, except
for column "Dist.Func" whose cells were automatically filled.
</p>
<p><strong>parcoord</strong>: Same as <strong>parcoord</strong> when <em>mode = "inter"</em>.
