<h2>Tutorial 5 Genomic Contact Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing 734 genomic contact pairs for reproducing Tutorial 5.
Here, we take a set of 734 pairs of i and j 40-kilobase DNA regions that are
known to be in contact inside a cell. Binning the DNA (e.g., a single chromosome)
into 40-kb regions, each region is represented as a single integer that is equal
to its end position divided by the length of the region, which is 40 kb. For
instance, the 1st region, with start and end positions at the 1st and 40000th
nucleotides, respectively, is denoted as 1 (40000th base / 40000 bases = 1).
This simplifies the notation for a contact between two regions to a pair of
positive integers as in used in this dataset.
