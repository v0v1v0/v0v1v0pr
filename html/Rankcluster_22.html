<h2>Rank data: sports</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set is due to Louis Roussos who asked 130 students at the
University of Illinois to rank seven sports according to their preference in participating:
A = Baseball, B = Football, C = Basketball, D = Tennis, E = Cycling, F =
Swimming, G = Jogging.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list containing:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>data</dt>
<dd>
<p>a matrix containing 130 ranks of size 7 in ranking representation.
</p>
<p>The ranking representation r=(r_1,...,r_m) contains the  ranks assigned to the objects, and means that
the ith object is in r_ith position.
</p>
<p>For example, if the ranking representation of a rank is (4,3,1,2,5), it means that judge ranks the first
object in 4th position, second object in 3rd position, ...</p>
</dd>
<dt>frequency</dt>
<dd>
<p>a matrix with 123 different ranks of size 7. In each row the first 7 columns correspond to one
observed ranking and the last column contains the observation frequency.</p>
</dd>
<dt>m</dt>
