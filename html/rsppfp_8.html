<h2>igraph Shortest Path</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A original node N_i can appear on a transformed gStar as different N_i* equivalent
nodes. Therefore, this becomes a limitation when searching for a shortest path inside gStar.
As a result: all N_i* need to be considered as possible destination nodes when looking for
the shortest path. This function is a wrapper for this behavior, providing a straightforward
implementation using igraph capabilities. However, it aims to provide
guidance on how to build a similar algorithm for different path-finding algorithms.
</p>
<p>It is important to mention that new nodes are only considered as destination nodes, and they
are not search for origin nodes. This is because N* nodes can only be reached after traveling
through gStar nodes. For example, a node <code>"f|e|r"</code> is actually indicating that <code>"r"</code>
has been reached after traveling through the nodes <code>"f"</code> and <code>"e"</code>.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_shortest_path(g, origin, dest, weightColName = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>g</code></td>
<td>
<p>A gStar digraph in data frame format, translated using one of the available functions.
The weight or cost attribute of each arc of the graph must be stored in a specific column
named <code>weight</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>origin</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the starting node from G for the path. It must be written as it
appears in G, and it is preferable to use a character format, but this can also be of
any simple type. No lists or vectors are allowed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dest</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the destination node from G for the path. It must be written as it
appears in G, and it is preferable to use a character format, but this can also be of any
simple type. No lists or vectors are allowed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weightColName</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the weight column used in the dataframe. If the column does not
exist, a name _must_ be provided so that a new weight column is generated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The shortest path from <code>origin</code> node to <code>dest</code> node, calculated in G*, to
include the forbidden paths. It uses igraph's functionalities.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Given a specific gStar graph:
gStar &lt;- data.frame(from = c("u|v", "s|u|v", "s|u", "s", "s", "u", "w", "w", "x", "x",
