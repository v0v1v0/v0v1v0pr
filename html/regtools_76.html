<h2>
Silicon Valley programmers and engineers data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set is adapted from the 2000 Census (5% sample, person
records).  It is mainly restricted to programmers and engineers in the 
Silicon Valley area.  (Apparently due to errors, there are some from
other ZIP codes.)
</p>
<p>There are three versions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>prgeng</code>, the original data, with categorical variables,
e.g. Occupation, in their original codes
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>peDumms</code>, same but with categorical variables
converted to dummies; due to the large number of levels the birth
and PUMA data is not included
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>peFactors</code>, same but with categorical variables
converted to factors
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pef</code>, same as <code>peFactors</code>, but having only columns
for age, education, occupation, gender, wage income and weeks
worked.  The education column has been collapsed to Master's degree,
PhD and other.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The variable codes, e.g. occupational codes, are available from 
<a href="https://usa.ipums.org/usa/volii/occ2000.shtml">https://usa.ipums.org/usa/volii/occ2000.shtml</a>.
