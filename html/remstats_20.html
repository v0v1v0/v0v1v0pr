<h2>indegreeReceiver</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Specifies the statistic for an 'indegreeReceiver' effect in the tie-oriented
model or the receiver choice step of the actor-oriented model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">indegreeReceiver(scaling = c("none", "prop", "std"), consider_type = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scaling</code></td>
<td>
<p>the method for scaling the degree statistic. Default is
to not scale the statistic (scaling = "none"). Alternatively,
scaling of the raw degree counts by the number of past events at time t can
be requested with 'prop' or standardization of the raw degree counts per
time point can be requested with 'std'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>consider_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, indicates whether to count the degrees
separately for each event type (TRUE, default) or sum degrees across
different event types (FALSE).</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An indegree of the receiver effect refers to the tendency for actors to
receive events if they have received more past events. The statistic at
timepoint <em>t</em> for dyad <em>(i,j)</em> (tie-oriented model) or
receiver <em>j</em> (actor-oriented model) is equal to the number of events
received by actor <em>j</em> before timepoint <em>t</em>. Note that the
'indegreeReceiver' effect is only defined for directed events.
</p>
<p>Optionally, a scaling method can be set with <code>scaling</code>. By scaling the
degree count by the total number of past events, the statistic refers to the
fraction of past events that were received by actor j. At the first time
point, when no events did previously occur, it is assumed that every actor
is equally likely to receive a message and the statistic is set equal to 1/
n, where n refers to the number of actors.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>List with all information required by 'remstats::remstats()' to 
compute the statistic.

<h3>Examples</h3>

effects &lt;- ~ indegreeReceiver()
remstats(reh = reh_tie, tie_effects = effects)
