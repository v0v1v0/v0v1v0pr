<h2>rgoogleslides: From R to Slides</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Previously, when one is working with in the Google Ecosystem (Using Google Drive etc),
there is hardly any good workflow of getting the values calculated from R and getting that into
Google Slides. The normal and easy way out would be to just copy your work over but when you have a
number of analysis to present with a lot of changes between each environment, it just becomes quite
cumbersome.
</p>
<p>Hence, this package is created to resolve such issues, providing a smoother workflow
for such cases.
