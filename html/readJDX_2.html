<h2>Import a File Written in the JCAMP-DX Format</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function supervises the entire import process.
Not all official formats are supported, see the vignettes.
Prior to release, this package is checked against a very large number of files in the
author's collection.  However, the JCAMP-DX standard allows many variations and it is
difficult to anticipate all permutations.  Error messages will
generally let you know what's going on.  If you have a file that you feel should be
supported but gives an error, please file an issue at Github and share the file.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">readJDX(file = "", SOFC = TRUE, debug = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character.  The file name to import.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SOFC</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical.  "Stop on Failed Check"
The default is <code>TRUE</code> i.e. stop when something is not right.
This ensures that correct data is returned.  Change to <code>FALSE</code> at your own risk.
NOTE: Only certain checks can be skipped via this option, as there are some
parameters that must be available and correct in order to return <em>any</em> answer.
For instance, one must end up with the same number of X and Y values.
This option is provided for those <span class="pkg">advanced
users</span> who have carefully checked their original files and want to skip the
required checks.  It may also be useful for troubleshooting.
The JCAMP-DX standard typically requires
several checks of the data as it is decompressed.  These checks are essential
to obtaining the correct results.  However, some JCAMP-DX writing programs
do not follow the standard to the letter.  For instance we have observed that
not all JCAMP-DX writers put FIRSTY into the metadata, even though it is required by
the standard.  In other cases values in the file have low precision (see section on precision).
Another example we have observed is NMR files where the X values are the count/index of data points,
and FIRSTY is given in Hz.  Since the field strength and center of the sweep frequency are needed
to convert to ppm, and these are parameters not required in the standard, one cannot return an
answer in either ppm or Hz automatically.
In cases like this, one can set <code>SOFC = FALSE</code> and then manually convert the X axis.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list, as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The first element is a data frame summarizing the pieces of the imported file.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The second element is the file metadata.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The third element is a integer vector giving the comment lines found
(exclusive of the metdata, which typically contains many comments).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional elements contain the extracted data as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> If the file contains one non-NMR spectrum, or a processed NMR spectrum (i.e. only 
the final real data), a single data frame.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If the file contains the real and imaginary
parts of a 1D NMR spectrum, there will be two data frames, one containing the real portion
and the other the imaginary portion.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> In all cases above, the data frame has elements <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> In the case of 2D NMR data, additional named list elements are returned including
the F2 frequency values, the F1 frequency values, and a matrix containing the 2D data.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> In the case of LC-MS or GC-MS data, a data frame is returned for each time point.
The data frame has elements <code>mz</code> and <code>int</code> (intensity). Each time point
is named with the time from the file.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Included Data Files</h3>

<p>The examples make use of data files included with the package:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> File <code>SBO.jdx</code> is an IR spectrum of Smart Balance Original spread (a butter
substitute). The spectrum is presented in transmission format, and was recorded on a
ThermoFisher instrument.  The file uses AFFN compression, and was written
with the JCAMP-DX 5.01 standard. Note that even though the Y-axis was recorded in
percent transmission, in the JDX file it is stored on [0...1].
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> File <code>PCRF.jdx</code> is a 1H NMR spectrum of a hexane extract of a reduced fat potato chip.
The spectrum was recorded on a JEOL instrument.  The file uses SQZ DIF DUP compression,
and was written with the JCAMP-DX 6.00 standard.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> File <code>PCRF_line265.jdx</code> has a deliberate error in it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> File <code>isasspc1.jdx</code> is a 2D NMR file recorded on a JEOL GX 400 instrument.
The file is freely available at <a href="http://www.jcamp-dx.org/">http://www.jcamp-dx.org/</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> File <code>MiniDIFDUP.JDX</code> is a small demonstration file, used in the vignettes to
illustrate the decompression process.  It is derived from a freely available file.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Precision</h3>

<p>Internally, this package uses a tolerance factor when comparing values during certain checks.
This is desirable because the original values in the files
are text strings of varying lengths which get converted to numerical values by <code>R</code>.  Occasionally
values in the file, such as FIRSTY, are stored with low precision, and the computation of the
value to be compared occurs with much greater precision.  In these cases the check can fail
even when the tolerance is pretty loose.  In these cases one might consider setting
<code>SOFC = FALSE</code> to allow the calculation to proceed.  If you do this, be certain to check
the results carefully as described under <code>SOFC</code>.
</p>


<h3>Y Value Check</h3>

<p>The standard requires a "Y Value Check" when in DIF mode.  Extra Y values have been appended to each
line to use in the check, and the last Y value on a line must equal the first Y value on the next line
<em>IFF</em> one is in DIF mode.  After a successful check, the extra Y value must be removed.  In actual practice,
some vendors, at least some of the time, seem to differ as to the meaning of
"being in DIF mode".  In turn, this determines how the Y value check should proceed.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The standard says "When, and only when, the last ordinate of a line is in DIF form ...
The first ordinate of the next line ... is always an actual value, equal to the last
calculated ordinate of the previous line". See section 5.8.3 of the 1988 publication.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Taking this definition literally, the Y value check (and removal of the extra value),
should occur when one sees e.g. ... DIF DIF DIF (end of line). Let's call
this "literal DIF".  A literal DIF is easy to detect and act on.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> In other cases, something like ... DIF DUP DUP (end of line) is considered to be in DIF mode
for Y value check purposes. In these cases we have look backwards to see if we are in DIF mode.
Let's call this "relayed DIF".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> However, some vendors may treat ... DIF DUP DUP (end of line) as not in DIF mode, and hence
one should not do the Y value check and not remove any values, as this vendor would not have
added an extra Y value.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> In addition to these three possibilities, <code>readJDX</code> through versions 0.3.xx used a different
definition, namely if there were any DIF entries anywhere on the line, then DIF mode was
assumed and the Y value check carried out.  This worked for many files, but not all.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> In the 0.4.xx series, <code>readJDX</code> detects both the literal and relayed definitions and
tries to keep moving forward as much as possible.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performance</h3>

<p><code>readJDX</code> is not particularly fast.  Priority has been given to assuring correct answers,
helpful debugging messages and understandable code.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>Do <code>browseVignettes("readJDX")</code> for background information,
references, supported formats, and details about the roles of each function.
If you have a multiblock file (which contains multiple spectra, but not 2D NMR,
LC-MS or GC-MS data sets), please see
<code>splitMultiblockDX</code> for a function to break such files into
individual files which can then be processed in the normal way.
