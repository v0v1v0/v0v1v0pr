<h2> sample description file</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The sample description file contains all information concerning the samples
of a reverse phase protein experiment.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>tab delimeted text file
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The sample description file contains information for sample annotation and data analysis.
To identify the sample in the source well plate the columns <code>plate</code>, <code>row</code>, <code>column</code>
are obligatory. It is neccessary that every well that is spottet is described.
The columns <code>sample_type</code> and <code>sample</code> as well as <code>concentration</code> and
for serially diluted samples <code>dilution</code> are required for data analysis.
The column <code>dilSeriesID</code> is required for background correction based on serial dilutions.
Any additionally column can be added to describe further phenodata of interest.
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The data set contains original reverse phase protein array signals.
A549 cells were starved for 24 h and subsequently stimulated with six different HGF concentrations 
ranging from 0 - 100 ng/ml. 
Samples were obtained at six different time points ranging from 0 - 120 min. 
The experiment was done in triplicates, and the samples were analysed by RPPA using antibodies 
directed against proteins and phosphoproteins of MET receptor signalling.
