<h2>A Simulated RDS Data Set with extreme seed dependency</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a faux set used to demonstrate RDS functions and analysis.  The
population had N=715 nodes.  In this case, the sample size is 500 so that
there is a relatively large sample fraction (70%). There is homophily on
disease status (R=5) and there is differential activity by disease status
whereby the infected nodes have mean degree twice that of the uninfected
(w=1.8).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An rds.data.frame plus the original network as a network object
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the sampling the seeds are chosen randomly from the infected population,
so there is extreme dependency induced by seed selection.
</p>
<p>Each sample member is given 2 uniquely identified coupons to distribute to
other members of the target population in their acquaintance.  Further each
respondent distributes their coupons completely at random from among those
they are connected to.
</p>
<p>With 70% sample, the VH is substantially biased, so the SS (and presumably
MA) do much better.  We expect the MA to perform a bit better than the SS.
</p>
<p>It is network 702 and its sample from YesYes on mosix. Look for
"extract702.R" <br> The original network is included as
<code>fauxsycamore.network</code> as a <code>network</code> object.  <br> The data set
also includes the <code>data.frame</code> of the RDS data set as
<code>fauxsycamore</code>.  <br> Use <code>data(package="RDS")</code> to get a full list
of datasets.
