<h2>Extract radiometry data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Extract radiometry from images taken with the aid of a portable light source
and the calibration board detailed in <code>calibrate_lens()</code>. The end goal is to
obtain the data required to model the vignetting effect.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">extract_radiometry(l, size_px = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>l</code></td>
<td>
<p>List of prepossessed images (SpatRaster) for radiometry
sampling. These images must comply with the equidistant projection.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>size_px</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector of length one. Diameter in pixels of the
circular sampling area at the image center. This area is modified
considering the equidistant projection distortion. Therefore, it will be
visualized as an ellipse at any other place but the image center.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Lenses have the inconvenient property of increasingly attenuating light in
the direction orthogonal to the optical axis. This phenomenon is known as the
vignetting effect and varies with lens model and aperture setting. The method
outlined here, known as the simple method, is explained in details in
Díaz and et al. (2024). Next explanation might serve mostly
as a quick recap of it.
</p>
<p>The development of the simple method was done with a Kindle Paperwhite eBooks
reader of 6" with built-in light. However, an iPhone 6 plus was also tested
in the early stages of development and no substantial differences were
observed. A metal bookends desk book holder was used to fasten the eBook
reader upright and a semi-transparent paper to favor a Lambertian light
distribution. In addition, the latter was used to draw on in order to
guide pixel sampling. The book holder also facilitated the alignment of the
screen with the dotted lines of the printed quarter-circle.

<p><img src="../help/figures/lightSource.jpg" alt="Portable light source"></p>
<p>As a general guideline, a wide variety of mobile devices could be used as
light sources, but if scattered data points are obtained with it, then other
light sources should be tested in order to double check that the light
quality is not the reason for points scattering.
</p>
<p>With the room only illuminated by the portable light source, nine photographs
should be taken with the light source located in the equivalent to 0, 10, 20,
30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 degrees of zenith angle, respectively. Camera
configuration should be in manual mode and set with the aperture (f/number)
for which a vignetting function is required. The shutter speed should be
regulated to obtain light-source pixels with middle grey values. The nine
photographs should be taken <strong>without changing the camera configuration or
the light conditions</strong>.
</p>

<p>This code exemplify how to use the function to obtain the data and base R
functions to obtain the vignetting function (<code class="reqn">f_v</code>).

<p>Once one of the aperture settings is calibrated, it can be used to calibrate
all the rest. To do so,  the equipment should be used to take photographs in
all desired exposition and without moving the camera, including the aperture
already calibrated and preferably under an open sky in stable diffuse light
conditions. The same procedure, which minor adaptations, is applicable to
cross-camera calibration. Below code could be used as a template.
