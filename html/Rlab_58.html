<h2>
Magnetic force of an electomagnet as a function of voltage and number of wire turns.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The magnet dataset is from an experiment concerning
the magnetic force of an electomagnet as a function
of voltage and number of wire turns. The device
was a wire wrapped around a core and measured at a
variety of voltages. The statistical design here is
actually a randomized complete block design where
the three eletromagnets are the blocks, and the
three voltages are levels of the factor voltage.
