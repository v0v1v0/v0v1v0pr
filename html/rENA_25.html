<h2>Accumulate data from a data frame into a set of adjacency (co-occurrence) vectors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function initializes an ENAdata object, processing conversations from coded data to generate adjacency (co-occurrence) vectors
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ena.accumulate.data(
  units = NULL,
  conversation = NULL,
  codes = NULL,
  metadata = NULL,
  model = c("EndPoint", "AccumulatedTrajectory", "SeparateTrajectory"),
  weight.by = "binary",
  window = c("MovingStanzaWindow", "Conversation"),
  window.size.back = 1,
  window.size.forward = 0,
  mask = NULL,
  include.meta = T,
  as.list = T,
  ...
)
</code></pre>

<td>
<p>A data frame where the columns are the codes used to create adjacency (co-occurrence) vectors</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>metadata</code></td>
<td>
<p>(optional) A data frame with additional columns of metadata to be associated with each unit in the data</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character, choices: EndPoint (or E), AccumulatedTrajectory (or A), or SeparateTrajectory (or S); default: EndPoint. Determines the ENA model to be constructed</p>

<p>(optional) A function to apply to values after accumulation</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>window</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character, choices are Conversation (or C), MovingStanzaWindow (MSW, MS); default MovingStanzaWindow. Determines how stanzas are constructed, which defines how co-occurrences are modeled</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>window.size.back</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive integer, Inf, or character (INF or Infinite), default: 1. Determines, for each line in the data frame, the number of previous lines in a conversation to include in the stanza window, which defines how co-occurrences are modeled</p>

<td><code>window.size.forward</code></td>
<td>
<p>(optional) A positive integer, Inf, or character (INF or Infinite), default: 0. Determines, for each line in the data frame, the number of subsequent lines in a conversation to include in the stanza window, which defines how co-occurrences are modeled</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mask</code></td>
<td>
<p>(optional) A binary matrix of size ncol(codes) x ncol(codes). 0s in the mask matrix row i column j indicates that co-occurrence will not be modeled between code i and code j</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>ENAData objects are created using this function. This accumulation receives
separate data frames for units, codes, conversation, and optionally, metadata. It
iterates through the data to create an adjacency (co-occurrence) vector corresponding
to each unit - or in a trajectory model multiple adjacency (co-occurrence) vectors for
each unit.
</p>
<p>In the default MovingStanzaWindow model, co-occurrences between codes are
calculated for each line k in the data between line k and the window.size.back-1 previous
lines and window.size.forward-1 subsequent lines in the same conversation as line k.
</p>
<p>In the Conversation model, co-occurrences between codes are calculated across all lines in
each conversation. Adjacency (co-occurrence) vectors are constructed for each unit u by
summing the co-occurrences for the lines that correspond to u.
</p>
<p>Options for how the data is accumulated are endpoint, which produces one adjacency (co-occurrence)
vector for each until summing the co-occurrences for all lines, and two trajectory models:
AccumulatedTrajectory and SeparateTrajectory. Trajectory models produce an adjacency
(co-occurrence) model for each conversation for each unit. In a SeparateTrajectory model,
each conversation is modeled as a separate network. In an AccumulatedTrajectory model, the
adjacency (co-occurrence) vector for the current conversation includes the co-occurrences
from all previous conversations in the data.
