<h2>Sage Thrasher detection data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Point transect data collected in central Wyoming from 120 points
surveyed for Sage Thrashers by the Wyoming Cooperative Fish &amp; Wildlife Research Unit in 2013.
See package vignettes for tutorials of the basic analysis.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data.frame containing 193 rows and 3 columns.  Each row represents
a detected group of thrashers.  Column descriptions: 
</p>
 
<ol>
<li> <p><code>siteID</code>: Factor (120 levels), the site or point where the detection
was made.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>groupsize</code>: Number, the number of individuals within
the detected group.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>dist</code>: Number, the radial distance (m) from
the transect to the detected group.  This is the distance used in analysis.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The Sage Thrasher data are a subset of the data collected 
by Jason Carlisle and various field technicians for his Ph.D. from the 
Department of Ecology, University of Wyoming, in 2017.  This portion of 
Jason's work was funded by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department through agreements 
with the University of Wyoming's  Cooperative Fish &amp; Wildlife
Research Unit (2012).
