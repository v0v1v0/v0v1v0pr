<h2>
Monte Carlo resampling of WIC/TNW for the discrete case
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The program calculates the Total Niche Width (TNW), and breaks TNW down into its Between Individual Component (BIC) and Within Individual Component (WIC). It reports these three statistics and the proportion WIC/TNW. Niche widths of the population, within individuals, and among individuals are calculated using the Shannon-Weaver diversity index on count data, following Roughgarden's formulas (1974) and Bolnick et al. (2002).
A Monte Carlo resampling routine is used to calculate a null distribution for each of these statistics and generate a p-value testing the null hypothesis that all individuals sample equally from the population diet distribution. Note that the bootstrapping procedure is only biologically meaningful when applied to integer data representing counts of individual prey within individual predators' diets, and should not be applied to other forms of data such as prey mass or proportion of total volume.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Roughgarden's measures are the most widely reported indices of diet variation, due to historical precedent. They are closely analogous to an Analysis of Variance, in that one partitions the total variation in resource use (TNW) into within- and between-individual components (WIC and BIC). An advantage of this approach is that one can simultaneously evaluate the degree of diet variation (WIC/TNW), and shifts in individual and population niche widths. A drawback is that, for categorical diet data, the Shannon-Weaver measure of diversity can lead to biased estimates of diet variation (Bolnick et al. 2002). Despite its historical precedent, users are advised to avoid using WIC/TNW. This bias is not a concern for WIC/TNW measured on quantitative traits (prey size) rather than prey categories, but this is rarely done.
</p>
<p>Roughgarden (1979, pg 510) proposed a measure to describe the niche width based on Shannon-Weaver information theory. The following formulae are equivalent to Roughgarden's formulation, although we use different notation. Let N be a matrix of diet data, where elements <code class="reqn">n_{ij}</code> represent the number (or mass) of diet items in individual i's diet that fall in category j. This raw data matrix is then transformed into a proportion matrix P, with elements <code class="reqn">p_{ij}</code> describing the proportion of the jth resource category in individual (or phenotype) i's diet.
</p>
<p>Using these proportions or the raw numerical counts one then calculates population diet proportions (<code class="reqn">q_{k}</code>, see <code>pop.diet</code> for details). These data can then be used to calculate WIC, BIC, and TNW (Roughgarden 1979; Bolnick et al. 2002):
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">WIC = \sum_i{p_i} (- \sum_k{p_{ik} ln(p_{ik})})</code>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">BIC = \sum_k{p_i ln(p_i)} - \sum_k{q_k (- \sum_i{t_{ik}ln(t_{ik})})}</code>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">TNW = - \sum_k{q_k ln(q_k)}</code>
</p>

<p>where: <code class="reqn">p_i</code> is the proportion of all resources used by individual i (<code class="reqn">\frac{\sum_k{n_{ik}}}{\sum_{ik}{n_{ik}}}</code>); <code class="reqn">q_k</code> is the proportion of the kth resource category in the population's niche, and <code class="reqn">t_{ik}</code> is the proportion of the population's total use of resource k that was used by individual i (i.e., <code class="reqn">\frac{n_{ik}}{\sum_i{n_{ik}}}</code>).
</p>
<p>It is important to remember that TNW = BIC + WIC, and one can easily calculate the proportion WIC, which we refer to as WIC/TNW.
</p>
<p>Be aware that monophagous individuals (100% of diet from a single resource) have excessively large leverage drawing WIC towards zero, possibly leading to downward-biased WIC/TNW exaggerating individual specialization. The procedure prints a warning message with the name of monophagous individuals in the dataset.
</p>
<p>The Monte Carlo resampling procedure first determines the number of prey used by each individual, <code class="reqn">n_i</code>. It then determines the frequencies with which the population as a whole used the various resources (see <code>pop.diet</code> for details). Subsequently, the procedure randomly reassigns each individual <code class="reqn">n_i</code> prey drawn from the population frequency distribution, and then recalculates a null measure of diet variation. This is repeated a user-specified number of times. Hence, the resampled population yields a null model corresponding to a population composed of generalists that sample randomly from the population's diet, and have diet sizes equal to those of the observed data set.
The original statistics are merged into the Monte Carlo set.
