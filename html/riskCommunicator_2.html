<h2>The <code>framingham</code> data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Framingham Heart Study is a long term prospective study of the etiology of 
cardiovascular disease among a population of free living subjects in the community of Framingham, Massachusetts. The Framingham 
Heart Study was a landmark study in epidemiology in that it was the first prospective study of cardiovascular disease and 
identified the concept of risk factors and their joint effects. The study began in 1948 and 5,209 subjects were initially 
enrolled in the study. Participants have been examined biennially since the inception of the study and all subjects are 
continuously followed through regular surveillance for cardiovascular outcomes. Clinic examination data has included 
cardiovascular disease risk factors and markers of disease such as blood pressure, blood chemistry, lung function, smoking 
history, health behaviors, ECG tracings, Echocardiography, and medication use. Through regular surveillance of area hospitals,
participant contact, and death certificates, the Framingham Heart Study reviews and adjudicates events for the occurrence of 
Angina Pectoris, Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, and Cerebrovascular disease.
The enclosed dataset is a subset of the data collected as part of the Framingham study and includes laboratory, clinic, 
questionnaire, and adjudicated event data on 4,434 participants. Participant clinic data was collected during three examination 
periods, approximately 6 years apart, from roughly 1956 to 1968. Each participant was followed for a total of 24 years for the 
outcome of the following events: Angina Pectoris, Myocardial Infarction, Atherothrombotic Infarction or Cerebral Hemorrhage 
(Stroke) or death.
