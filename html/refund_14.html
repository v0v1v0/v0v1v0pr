<h2>The US weekly all-cause mortality and COVID19-associated deaths in 2020</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The COVID19 mortality data used in the "Functional Data Analysis with R" book
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(COVID19)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list made up of </p>

<dl>
<dt>US_weekly_mort</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric vector of length 207, which contains the 
total number of weekly all-cause deaths in the US from January 14, 2017 to December 26, 2020;</p>
</dd>
<dt>US_weekly_mort_dates</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector of dates of length 207, which contains 
the weeks corresponding to the US_weekly_mort vector;</p>
</dd>
<dt>US_weekly_mort_CV19</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric vector of length 52, which contains the 
total number of weekly COVID 19 deaths in the US from January 4, 2020 to December 26, 2020;</p>
</dd>
<dt>US_weekly_mort_CV19_dates</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector of dates of length 52, which contains 
the weeks corresponding to the US_weekly_mort_CV19 vector;</p>
</dd>
<dt>US_weekly_excess_mort_2020</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric vector of length 52, which contains 
the US weekly excess mortality (total mortality in one week in 2020 minus 
total mortality in the corresponding week of 2019) from January 4, 2020 to December 26, 2020;</p>
</dd>
<dt>US_weekly_excess_mort_2020_dates</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector dates of length 52, which contains 
the weeks corresponding to the US_weekly_excess_mort_2020 vector.;</p>
</dd>
<dt>US_states_names</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector of strings containing the names of 52 US states 
and territories in alphabetic order. These are the states for which all-cause 
and Covid-19 data are available in this data set;</p>
</dd>
<dt>US_states_population</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric vector containing the population of the 
52 states in the vector US_states_names estimated as of July 1, 2020. The 
order of the vector US_states_population is the same as that of US_states_names;</p>
</dd>
<dt>States_excess_mortality</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric 52 x 52 dimensional matrix that 
contains the weekly US excess mortality in 52 states and territories. Each 
row corresponds to one state in the same order as the vector US_states_names. 
Each column corresponds to a week in 2020 corresponding to the order in the 
vector US_weekly_excess_mort_2020_dates. The (i,j)th entry of the matrix is 
the difference in all-cause mortality during the week j of 2020 and 2019 for state i;</p>
</dd>
<dt>States_excess_mortality_per_million</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric 52 x 52 dimensional matrix 
that contains the weekly US excess mortality in 52 states and territories 
per one million individuals. This is obtained by dividing every row (corresponding 
to a state) of States_excess_mortality by the population of that state stored 
in US_states_population and multiplying by one million;</p>
</dd>
<dt>States_CV19_mortality</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric 52 x 52 dimensional matrix that contains 
the weekly US Covid-19 mortality in 52 states and territories. Each row 
corresponds to one state in the same order as the vector US_states_names. Each 
column corresponds to a week in 2020 corresponding to the order in the 
vector US_weekly_excess_mort_2020_dates;</p>
</dd>
<dt>States_CV19_mortality_per_million</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric 52 x 52 dimensional matrix 
that contains the weekly US Covid-19 mortality in 52 states and territories 
per one million individuals. This is obtained by dividing every row (corresponding 
to a state) of States_CV19_mortality by the population of that state stored 
in US_states_population and multiplying by one million.</p>
