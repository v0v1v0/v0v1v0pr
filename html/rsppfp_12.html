<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Transformation algorithms to translate the SPPFP (Shortest Path Problem with Forbidden
Paths) to a traditional shortest-path problem that includes the forbidden paths.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The SPPFP is a variant of the traditional shortest path problem, in which no solution
can include any path listed on a known set of forbidden paths. The current approach
to solve this is to translate the existing graph, and its set of forbidden paths,
to a graph in which no path will include any forbidden sequence.
This package provides straightforward parallel processing capabilities, as well as
translation functions to use the algorithms on undirected graphs. It is highly
compatible with other network research packages, as it only uses native R data types.
