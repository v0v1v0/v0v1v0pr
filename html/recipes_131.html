<h2>Manually alter roles</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>update_role()</code> alters an existing role in the recipe or assigns an initial
role to variables that do not yet have a declared role.
</p>
<p><code>add_role()</code> adds an <em>additional</em> role to variables that already have a role
in the recipe. It does not overwrite old roles, as a single variable can have
multiple roles.
</p>
<p><code>remove_role()</code> eliminates a single existing role in the recipe.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_role(recipe, ..., new_role = "predictor", new_type = NULL)

update_role(recipe, ..., new_role = "predictor", old_role = NULL)

remove_role(recipe, ..., old_role)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>recipe</code></td>
<td>
<p>An existing <code>recipe()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>One or more selector functions to choose which variables are being
assigned a role. See <code>selections()</code> for more details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>new_role</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string for a single role.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>new_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string for specific type that the variable should
be identified as. If left as <code>NULL</code>, the type is automatically identified
as the <em>first</em> type you see for that variable in <code>summary(recipe)</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>old_role</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string for the specific role to update for the
variables selected by <code>...</code>. <code>update_role()</code> accepts a <code>NULL</code> as long as
the variables have only a single role.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>update_role()</code>, <code>add_role()</code> and <code>remove_role()</code> will be applied on a recipe
before any of the steps or checks, regardless of where they are located in
position. This means that roles can only be changed with these three
functions for columns that are already present in the original data supplied
to <code>recipe()</code>. See the <code>role</code> argument in some step functions to update
roles for columns created by steps.
</p>
<p>Variables can have any arbitrary role (see the examples) but there are three
special standard roles, <code>"predictor"</code>, <code>"outcome"</code>, and <code>"case_weights"</code>.
The first two roles are typically required when fitting a model.
</p>
<p><code>update_role()</code> should be used when a variable doesn't currently have a role
in the recipe, or to replace an <code>old_role</code> with a <code>new_role</code>. <code>add_role()</code>
only adds additional roles to variables that already have roles and will
throw an error when the current role is missing (i.e. <code>NA</code>).
</p>
<p>When using <code>add_role()</code>, if a variable is selected that already has the
<code>new_role</code>, a warning is emitted and that variable is skipped so no duplicate
roles are added.
</p>
<p>Adding or updating roles is a useful way to group certain variables that
don't fall in the standard <code>"predictor"</code> bucket. You can perform a step on
all of the variables that have a custom role with the selector <code>has_role()</code>.
</p>


<h4>Effects of non-standard roles</h4>

<p>Recipes can label and retain column(s) of your data set that should not be treated as outcomes or predictors. A unique identifier column or some other ancillary data could be used to troubleshoot issues during model development but may not be either an outcome or predictor.
</p>
<p>For example, the <code>modeldata::biomass</code> dataset has a column named <code>sample</code> with information about the specific sample type. We can change that role:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>library(recipes)

data(biomass, package = "modeldata")
biomass_train &lt;- biomass[1:100,]
biomass_test &lt;- biomass[101:200,]

rec &lt;- recipe(HHV ~ ., data = biomass_train) %&gt;%
  update_role(sample, new_role = "id variable") %&gt;%
  step_center(carbon)

rec &lt;- prep(rec, biomass_train)
</pre></div>
<p>This means that <code>sample</code> is no longer treated as a <code>"predictor"</code> (the default role for columns on the right-hand side of the formula supplied to <code>recipe()</code>) and won't be used in model fitting or analysis, but will still be retained in the data set.
</p>
<p>If you really aren't using <code>sample</code> in your recipe, we recommend that you instead remove <code>sample</code> from your dataset before passing it to <code>recipe()</code>. The reason for this is because recipes assumes that all non-standard roles are required at <code>bake()</code> time (or <code>predict()</code> time, if you are using a workflow). Since you didn't use <code>sample</code> in any steps of the recipe, you might think that you don't need to pass it to <code>bake()</code>, but this isn't true because recipes doesn't know that you didn't use it:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>biomass_test$sample &lt;- NULL

bake(rec, biomass_test)
#&gt; Error in `bake()`:
#&gt; x The following required columns are missing from `new_data`: `sample`.
#&gt; i These columns have one of the following roles, which are required at `bake()`
#&gt;   time: `id variable`.
#&gt; i If these roles are not required at `bake()` time, use
#&gt;   `update_role_requirements(role = "your_role", bake = FALSE)`.
</pre></div>
<p>As we mentioned before, the best way to avoid this issue is to not even use a role, just remove the <code>sample</code> column from <code>biomass</code> before calling <code>recipe()</code>. In general, predictors and non-standard roles that are supplied to <code>recipe()</code> should be present at both <code>prep()</code> and <code>bake()</code> time.
</p>
<p>If you can't remove <code>sample</code> for some reason, then the second best way to get around this issue is to tell recipes that the <code>"id variable"</code> role isn't required at <code>bake()</code> time. You can do that by using <code>update_role_requirements()</code>:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>rec &lt;- recipe(HHV ~ ., data = biomass_train) %&gt;%
  update_role(sample, new_role = "id variable") %&gt;%
  update_role_requirements("id variable", bake = FALSE) %&gt;%
  step_center(carbon)

rec &lt;- prep(rec, biomass_train)

# No errors!
biomass_test_baked &lt;- bake(rec, biomass_test)
</pre></div>
<p>It should be very rare that you need this feature.
</p>

<p>An updated recipe object.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
