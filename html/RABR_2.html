<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>MeanVec</code> is a vector of response mean for placebo and active treatment groups, while <code>SdVec</code> is for standard deviation. They should be with the same length. The current package supports 2 or 3 active treatment groups. Note that a larger response corresponds to a better outcome.
</p>
<p>The <code>M</code> is the total sample size of burn-in period with equal randomization. The total sample size <code>N</code> should be larger than N. The choice of <code>M</code> can be selected by comparing simulations from several candidate values. The <code>R</code> is a pre-specified randomization vector, where the first element is for placebo, and the next one for the best performing group, up to the worst performing group.
</p>
<p>The <code>Alpha</code> is the one-sided significance level. The <code>MultiMethod</code> can be set at "holm" for Holm, "hochberg" for Hochberg, "hommel" for Hommel, "bonferroni" for Bonferroni, or "dunnett" for Dunnett procedures.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>ProbUnadj: Probability of rejecting each elementary null hypothesis without multiplicity adjustment
</p>
<p>ProbAdj: Probability of rejecting each elementary null hypothesis with multiplicity adjustment
</p>
<p>ProbAdjSelected: Probability of selecting and confirming the efficacy of each active treatment group
</p>
<p>ProbAdjOverall: Probability of rejecting at least one elementary null hypothesis with multiplicity adjustment
</p>
<p>ASN: Average sample size of placebo and active treatment groups
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Consider an example with three active treatment
## groups and a placebo. Suppose that the response
## mean for placebo is 0.43 and 0.48, 0.63, and 1.2
## for three active treatment groups. The standard
## deviation is 1 for all groups. The total sample
## size is N = 120 with a burn-in period M = 60. We
## use the randomization vector of (8, 9, 2, 1),
## which means that placebo, the best performing
## group, the second-best group, and the worst group
## have randomization probabilities 8/20, 9/20, 2/20
## 1/20, respectively. The one-sided significance
## level is considered at 2.5%. Nitt = 100 is for
## demonstration, and should be increased to 10^5
## in practice.
