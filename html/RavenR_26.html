<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Files are downloaded from the Raven webpage (<a href="https://raven.uwaterloo.ca/Downloads.html">https://raven.uwaterloo.ca/Downloads.html</a>) and placed
in a temporary directory while the executable is extracted. This helps prevent any unwanted files being
saved on your system outside of temporary directories if the function is interrupted. The executable is placed in the
RavenR/extdata directory, wherever RavenR is installed on your system.
</p>
<p>Note that if you are not on a Windows operating system, you may need to compile Raven for your system rather than
</p>
<p>Any existing Raven.exe file in your RavenR/extdata folder will be overwritten with a newly downloaded executable w
with this function.
</p>
<p>The 'copy_path' argument may be useful for non-Windows users that are not able to use the pre-compiled Raven downloads.
If the path to an existing Raven.exe file (i.e. one compiled locally) is provided, this will copy the specified file to the
appropriate location and skip the download, which will allow the user to use the locally compiled Raven.exe with the 'rvn_run'
function.
</p>
<p>Reinstalling the RavenR package removes the previous files in the RavenR/ folder on your system, so this command
will need to be re-run if RavenR is re-installed.
</p>
<p>Once downloaded, the Raven.exe file can be found with <code>system.file("extdata", "Raven.exe", package="RavenR")</code>
</p>
