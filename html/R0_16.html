<h2>H1N1 serial interval</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Serial interval (in its core definition, i.e. the time delay between symptom
onset between pairs of infectors and infectees), taken from traced cases of
H1N1 viruses.
</p>
<p>Vector of values that represents the time lag between symptoms onset for pairs
of infector/infectee, for a dataset of complete traced cases. Each value

This serial interval is often substitued for the generation time distribution,
as it is easier to observe.
