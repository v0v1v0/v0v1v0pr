<h2>Row rule pack</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Row rule pack is a rule pack which defines a set of rules for
rows as a whole, i.e. functions which convert rows of interest to logical
values. It should return a data frame with the following properties:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Number of rows equals to <strong>number of checked rows</strong>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Column names should be treated as <strong>rule names</strong>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Values indicate whether the <strong>row as a whole</strong> follows the rule.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This format is inspired by <code>dplyr</code>'s transmute().
</p>
<p>The most common way to define row pack is by creating a
functional sequence containing <code>transmute(...)</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note about rearranging rows</h3>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that during exposure packs are applied to keyed object with id key. So they
can rearrange rows as long as it is done with functions supported by keyholder. Rows will be tracked and
recognized as in the original data frame of interest.

<pre><code class="language-R">some_row_mean_rules &lt;- . %&gt;%
