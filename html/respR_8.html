<h2>Run auto_rate on multiple replicates in intermittent-flow respirometry data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>auto_rate.int</code> allows you to run the <code>auto_rate()</code> function on multiple
replicates in intermittent-flow respirometry. A <code>wait</code> and <code>measure</code> phase
can be specified for each replicate, and the <code>auto_rate</code> analysis is
performed within the <code>measure</code> region.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">auto_rate.int(
  x,
  starts = NULL,
  wait = NULL,
  measure = NULL,
  by = "row",
  method = "linear",
  width = NULL,
  n = 1,
  plot = TRUE,
  ...
)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>auto_rate.int</code> uses the <code>starts</code> input to subset each replicate. The <code>wait</code>
and <code>measure</code> inputs control which parts of each replicate data are excluded
and included from the rate calculation. It runs <code>auto_rate</code> on the <code>measure</code>
phase in each replicate saving the top <code>n</code> ranked results and extracting the
rate and other data to a summary table.
</p>
<p>The <code>x</code> input should be an<code>inspect</code> object. Alternatively, it can be a
two-column data frame containing paired values of time and oxygen from an
intermittent-flow experiment in columns 1 and 2 respectively (though we
always recommend processing such data in <code>inspect()</code> first). If a multiple
column dataset is entered as <code>x</code> the first two columns are selected by
default. If these are not the intended data use <code>inspect</code> to select the
correct time and oxygen columns.
</p>


<h4>
<code>auto_rate</code> inputs</h4>

<p>You should be familiar with how <code>auto_rate</code> works before using this function.
See <code>help("auto_rate")</code> and vignettes on the website for full details.
</p>
<p>The <code>auto_rate</code> inputs can be changed by entering different <code>method</code> and
<code>width</code> inputs. The <code>by</code> input controls how the <code>width</code> is applied. Note if
using a proportional <code>width</code> input (i.e. between 0 and 1 representing a
proportion of the data length) this applies to the length of the <code>measure</code>
phase of each particular replicate.
</p>
<p>The <code>n</code> input controls how many <code>auto_rate</code> results from each replicate to
return in the output. By default this is only the top ranked result for the
particular <code>method</code>, i.e. <code>n = 1</code>. This can be changed to return more,
however consider carefully if this is necessary as the output will
necessarily contain many more rate results which may make it difficult to
explore and select results (although see <code>select_rate()</code>).
</p>



<h4>Specifying replicate structure</h4>

<p>The <code>starts</code> input specifies the locations of the start of each replicate in
the data in <code>x</code>. This can be in one of two ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> A single numeric value specifying the number of rows in each replicate
starting from the data in the first row. This option should only be used when
replicates cycle at regular intervals. This can be a regular row or time
interval, as specified via the <code>by</code> input. If the first replicate does not
start at row 1, the data should be subset so that it does (see
<code>subset_data()</code>) and example
<a href="https://januarharianto.github.io/respR/articles/intermittent_long.html">here</a>.
For example, <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠starts = 600, by = "row"⁠</code> means the first replicate starts at
row 1 and ends at row 600, the second starts at row 601 ends at 1200, and so
on.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A numeric vector of row locations or times, as specified via the <code>by</code>
input, of the start of each individual replicate. The first replicate does
not have to start at the first row of the data, and all data after the last
entry is assumed to be part of the final replicate. Regular <code>R</code> syntax such
as <code>seq()</code>, <code>1:10</code>, etc. is also accepted, so can be used to specify both
regular and irregular replicate spacing.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For both methods it is assumed each replicate ends at the row preceding the
start of the next replicate, or in the case of the last replicate the final
row of the dataset. Also for both methods, <code>by = "time"</code> inputs do not need
to be exact; the closest matching values in the time data are used.
</p>
<p>Results are presented in the <code>summary</code> table with <code>rep</code> and <code>rank</code> columns to
distinguish those from different replicates and their ranking within
replicates (if multiple results per replicate have been returned by
increasing the <code>n</code> input).
</p>



<h4>Specifying rate region</h4>

<p>The <code>wait</code> and <code>measure</code> inputs are used to specify the region from which to
extract a rate and exclude flush periods. They can be entered as row
intervals or time values in the units of the input data. The <code>wait</code> phase
controls the amount of data at the start of each replicate to be ignored,
that is excluded from any rate calculations. The <code>measure</code> phase determines
the region after this from which a rate is calculated. Unlike
<code>calc_rate.int()</code>, <code>auto_rate.int</code> will not necessarily use all of the data
in the <code>measure</code> phase, but will run the <code>auto_rate</code> analysis <em>within</em> it
using the <code>method</code>, <code>width</code> and <code>by</code> inputs. This may result in rates of
various widths depending on the inputs. See <code>auto_rate()</code> for defaults and
full details of how selection inputs are applied.
</p>
<p>There is no <code>flush</code> phase input since this is assumed to be from the end of
the <code>measure</code> phase to the end of the replicate.
</p>
<p>Both <code>wait</code> and <code>measure</code> can be entered in one of two ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Single numeric values specifying a row width or a time period, as specified
via the <code>by</code> input. Use this if you want to use the <em>same</em> <code>wait</code> and
<code>measure</code> phases in every replicate.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If <code>starts</code> is a vector of locations of the start of each replicate, these
inputs can also be vectors of equal length of row lengths or time periods as
specified via the <code>by</code> input. This is only useful if you want to use
<em>different</em> <code>wait</code> and/or <code>measure</code> phases in different replicates.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>wait = NULL</code> no wait phase is applied. If <code>measure = NULL</code> the data used
for analysis is from the start of the replicate or end of the <code>wait</code> phase to
the last row of the replicate. This will typically include the flush period,
so is rarely what you would want.
</p>



<h4>Example</h4>

<p>See examples below for actual code, but here is a simple example. An
experiment comprises replicates which cycle at ten minute intervals with data
recorded every second. Therefore each replicate will be 600 rows long.
Flushes of the respirometer take 3 minutes at the end of each replicate. We
want to exclude the first 2 minutes (120 rows) of data in each, and run an
<code>auto_rate</code> analysis to get an oxygen uptake rate within the following five
minute period (300 rows), leaving the three minutes of flushing (180 rows)
excluded. The inputs for this would be:
</p>
<p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠starts = 600, wait = 120, measure = 300, by = "row"⁠</code>
</p>



<h4>Plot</h4>

<p>If <code>plot = TRUE</code> (the default), the result for each rate is plotted on a grid
up to a maximum of 20. There are three ways of plotting the results, which
can be selected using the <code>type</code> input:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>type = "rep"</code>: The default. Each individual replicate is plotted with the
rate region highlighted in yellow. The <code>wait</code> and <code>measure</code> phases are also
highlighted as shaded red and green regions respectively. These are also
labelled if <code>legend = TRUE</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>type = "full"</code>: Each replicate rate is highlighted in the context of the
whole dataset. May be quite difficult to interpret if dataset is large.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>type = "ar"</code>: Plots individual replicate results as <code>auto_rate</code> objects.
Note, these will only show the <code>measure</code> phase of the data.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For all plot types <code>pos</code> can be used to select which rate(s) to plot (default
is 1:20), where <code>pos</code> indicates rows of the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$summary⁠</code> table (and hence which
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$rep⁠</code> and <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$rank⁠</code>). This can be passed either in the main function call or
when calling <code>plot()</code> on output objects. Note for all plot types if <code>n</code> has
been changed to return more than one rate per replicate these will also be
plotted.
</p>



<h4>S3 Generic Functions</h4>

<p>Saved output objects can be used in the generic S3 functions <code>plot()</code>,
<code>print()</code>, <code>summary()</code>, and <code>mean()</code>. For all of these <code>pos</code> selects rows of
the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$summary⁠</code> table.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>plot()</code>: plots the result. See Plot section above.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>print()</code>: prints the result of a single rate, by default the first. Others
can be printed by passing the <code>pos</code> input. e.g. <code>print(x, pos = 2)</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>summary()</code>: prints summary table of all results and metadata, or the rows
specified by the <code>pos</code> input. e.g. <code>summary(x, pos = 1:5)</code>. The <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$rep⁠</code> column
indicates the replicate number, and <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$rank⁠</code> column the ranking of each rate
<em>within</em> each replicate (only used if a different <code>n</code> has been passed,
otherwise they are all <code>1</code>). The summary table (or <code>pos</code> rows) can be
exported as a separate data frame by passing <code>export = TRUE</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>mean()</code>: calculates the mean of the rates from every row or those
specified by the <code>pos</code> input. e.g. <code>mean(x, pos = 1:5)</code> Note if a different
<code>n</code> has been passed this may include multiple rates from each replicate. The
mean can be exported as a numeric value by passing <code>export = TRUE</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Output is a <code>list</code> object of class <code>auto_rate.int</code> containing a
<code>auto_rate</code> object for each replicate in <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$results⁠</code>. The output also
contains a <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$summary⁠</code> table which includes the full rate regression results
from each replicate with replicate number indicated by the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$rep⁠</code> column.
Output also contains a <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$rate⁠</code> element which contains the rate values from
each replicate in order. The function call, inputs, and other metadata are
also included. Note, that if you have many replicates this object can be
rather large (several MB).
