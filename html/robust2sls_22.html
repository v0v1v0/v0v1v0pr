<h2>Impulse Indicator Saturation (IIS initial estimator)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Impulse Indicator Saturation (IIS initial estimator)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">iis_init(
  data,
  formula,
  gamma,
  t.pval = gamma,
  do.pet = FALSE,
  normality.JarqueB = NULL,
  turbo = FALSE,
  overid = NULL,
  weak = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dataframe.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>A formula in the format <code>y ~ x1 + x2 | x1 + z2</code> where
<code>y</code> is the dependent variable, <code>x1</code> are the exogenous regressors,
<code>x2</code> the endogenous regressors, and <code>z2</code> the outside instruments.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gamma</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the significance
level used for two-sided significance t-test on the impulse indicators.
Corresponds to the probability of falsely classifying an observation as an
outlier.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>t.pval</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the significance
level for the Parsimonious Encompassing Test (PET).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>do.pet</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. If <code>TRUE</code>, then a Parsimonious Encompassing Test (PET) against the GUM is undertaken at each regressor removal for the joint significance of all the deleted regressors along the current path. If FALSE (default), then a PET is not undertaken at each regressor removal. By default, the numeric value is the same as that of <code>t.pval</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>normality.JarqueB</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>NULL</code> (the default) or a value between 0 and 1. In the latter case, a test for non-normality is conducted using a significance level equal to <code>normality.JarqueB</code>. If <code>NULL</code>, then no test for non-normality is conducted</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>turbo</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. If <code>TRUE</code>, then (parts of) paths are not searched twice (or more) unnecessarily, thus yielding a significant potential for speed-gain. However, the checking of whether the search has arrived at a point it has already been comes with a slight computational overhead. Accordingly, if <code>turbo=TRUE</code>, then the total search time might in fact be higher than if <code>turbo=FALSE</code>. This happens if estimation is very fast, say, less than quarter of a second. Hence the default is <code>FALSE</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overid</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>NULL</code> if no Sargan test of overidentifying restrictions
should be used as a diagnostic check for model selection or a numeric value
between 0 and 1. In the latter case, the test is conducted using this value
as the significance level.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weak</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>NULL</code> if no weak instrument F-test on the first stage
should be used as a diagnostic check for model selection or a numeric value
between 0 and 1. In the latter case, the test is conducted using this value
as the significance level.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>iis_init</code> returns a list with five elements. The first
four are vectors whose length equals the number of observations in the data
set. Unlike the residuals stored in a model object (usually accessible via
<code>model$residuals</code>), it does not ignore observations where any of y, x
or z are missing. It instead sets their values to <code>NA</code>.
</p>
<p>The first element is a double vector containing the residuals for each
observation based on the model estimates. The second element contains the
standardised residuals, the third one a logical vector with <code>TRUE</code> if
the observation is judged as not outlying, <code>FALSE</code> if it is an outlier,
and <code>NA</code> if any of y, x, or z are missing. The fourth element of the
list is an integer vector with three values: 0 if the observations is judged
to be an outlier, 1 if not, and -1 if missing. The fifth and last element
stores the <code>ivreg</code> model object based on which the four
vectors were calculated.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>IIS runs multiple models, similar to <code>saturated_init</code> but with
multiple block search. These intermediate models are not recorded. For
simplicity, the element <code>$model</code> of the returned list stores the full
sample model result, identical to <code>robustified_init</code>.
