<h2>Create a random Peel network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates an example of a network from Peel's quintet of the specified type.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">generate_peels_network(
  type,
  k_values = c(1000, 500, 100),
  single_component = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character which is any of the capital letters A-E</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k_values</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer vector. The spring constant for the edge types within sub class, within class but not sub-class,
between classes. The default value is 1000, 500, 100. This means the strongest connection is for nodes in the same
sub-class and the weakest connection is for nodes in different classes</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>single_component</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Guarantees a single component network. Set to TRUE as default</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function generates networks matching the 5 types described in Peel et al 2019 (doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1713019115">10.1073/pnas.1713019115</a>). 
All networks have 40 nodes, 60 edges, two node classes and four node sub-classes. 
The connections between the are equal across all 5 types.
As a result all networks generated have identical assortativity. However, as the sub-classes have different connection
probability the structures produced by the networks are very different. When projected into SETSe space the network types
occupy there own area, see Bourne 2020 (doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-020-00329-4">10.1007/s41109-020-00329-4</a>) for details.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An igraph object that matches one of the 5 Peel's quintet types. The nodes are labeled with class and sub class.
The edges have attribute k which is the spring constant of the edge given relationship between the nodes the edge connects to

<h3>Examples</h3>

g &lt;- generate_peels_network(type = "E")
