<h2>Get '.nev' or 'nsx' specification</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Get '.nev' or 'nsx' specification
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_specification(version, type = c("nev", "nsx"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>version</code></td>
<td>
<p>either character string or a vector of two integers; for
example, <code>"2.2"</code>, <code>"2.3"</code>, <code>c(3, 0)</code>. Currently only these
three versions are supported since I was unable to find any other versions.
Please file an issue ticket if others versions are desired.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>file type; choices are <code>'nev'</code> or <code>'nsx'</code></p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The file specification as a list. The specification usually contains
three sections: basic header (fixed length), extended header
(dictionary-style), and data packets (data stream). The specification is
used to parse the data files.
</p>


<h3>'NEV' Data</h3>

<p>A 'NEV' object consists of three sections:
</p>
<p>Section 1 contains basic information such as the time-origin of all the
time-stamps, the time-stamp sampling frequency, data packets sizes.
</p>
<p>Section 2 is extended header containing the configurations of channels,
digital signals, etc. For any data packets in section 3, there should
be at least one table in this section describing the settings.
</p>
<p>section 3 is a collection of event packets such as digital signal inputs (
most likely to be used at version 2.2 or by 'Ripple'), spike waveform,
comments (sometimes storing epoch information), etc.
</p>
<p>Please be aware that while most common entries can be found across different
file versions, some entries are version-specific. If you are making your
script general, you need to be very careful handling these differences.
For more information, please search for the data specification manual
from the 'Blackrock-Microsystems' website.
</p>


<h3>'NSx' Data</h3>

<p>A 'NSx' file refers to the data files ending with <code>'ns1'</code> through
<code>'ns9'</code>. Common types are <code>'ns2'</code> (sampling at 1000 Hz),
<code>'ns3'</code> (sampling at 2000 Hz), and <code>'ns5'</code> (sampling at 30,000 Hz).
</p>
<p>A 'NSx' file also consists of three sections. Section 1 contains basic
information such as the time-origin of all the time-stamps, sampling
frequencies, and channel counts within the file. Please be careful that
item <code>time_resolution_timestamp</code> is not the sampling frequency for
signals. This item is the sampling frequency for time-stamp. To obtain the
signal sample rate, divided <code>time_resolution_timestamp</code> by
<code>period</code>. For example, <code>'ns3'</code> usually has time-stamp resolution
<code>30,000</code> and <code>period=15</code>, hence the signal sample rate is
<code>30000/15=2000Hz</code>.
</p>
<p>Section 2 usually contains one and only one channel table of which the
number of rows should coincide with number of channels from section 1. Other
information such as channel labels, physical connectors, pins, units, filter
settings, digital-to-analog conversion are also included. Since
<code>readNSx</code> always attempts to convert signals in 'volts' or 'milli-volts'
to 'micro-volts', the <code>'units'</code> column might be different to what's
actual recorded in the 'NSx' file headers.
</p>
<p>Section 3 contains partitions of continuous recording. When imported/loaded
from <code>readNSx</code>, the digital signals are always converted to analog
signals with 'micro-volts' unit. Please use <code>get_channel</code> to
get the channel data.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-R">
get_specification(version = c(2,3), type = "nev")

get_specification(version = "3.0", type = "nsx")
