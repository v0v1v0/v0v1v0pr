<h2>Randomized Response Survey on a sensitive questions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set contains observations from a randomized response survey conducted in a university to sensitive questions described below.
The sample is drawn by simple random sampling without replacement.
The randomized response technique used is the Horvitz model (Horvitz et al., 1967 and Greenberg et al., 1969) with parameter <code class="reqn">p=0.5</code>.
Each sensitive question is associated with a unrelated question.
</p>
<p>1. Were you born in July? with <code class="reqn">\alpha=1/12</code>
</p>
<p>2. Does your ID number end in 2? with <code class="reqn">\alpha=1/10</code>
</p>
<p>3. Were you born of 1 to 20 of the month? with <code class="reqn">\alpha=20/30</code>
</p>
<p>4. Does your ID number end in 5? with <code class="reqn">\alpha=1/10</code>
</p>
<p>5. Were you born of 15 to 25 of the month? with <code class="reqn">\alpha=10/30</code>
</p>
<p>6. Were you born in April? with <code class="reqn">\alpha=1/12</code>
</p>
