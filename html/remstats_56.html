<h2>reciprocity</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Specifies the statistic for a reciprocity effect in the tie-oriented model
or the receiver choice step of the actor-oriented model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">reciprocity(scaling = c("none", "prop", "std"), consider_type = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scaling</code></td>
<td>
<p>the method for scaling the reciprocity statistic. Default is
to not scale the statistic but keep the raw 'counts'. Alternatively, the
statistics can be scaled by 'prop', in which raw counts are
divided by the indegree of the sender at time t (see 'details') or
standardization of the raw counts per time point can be requested with 'std'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>consider_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, indicates whether to count the number of past
reciprocal events separately for each event type (TRUE, default) or sum
across different event types (FALSE).</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A reciprocity effect refers to the tendency for actors to reciprocate past
interactions. The statistic at timepoint <em>t</em> for dyad <em>(i,j)</em>
(tie-oriented model) or receiver <em>j</em> (actor-oriented model) is equal to
the number of <em>(j,i)</em> events before timepoint <em>t</em>. Note that a
reciprocity effect is only defined for directed events.
</p>
<p>Optionally, a scaling method can be set with <code>scaling</code>.  By scaling the
reciprocity count by the indegree of the sender, the statistic refers to the
fraction of messages received by actor i that were received from actor j. If
actor i hasn't received any messages yet it can be assumed that actor i is
equally likely to receive a message from every actor and the statistic is
set equal to 1/(n-1), where n refers to the number of actors. The resulting
statistic is similar to the "FrRecSnd" statistic in the R package 'relevent'.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>List with all information required by 'remstats::remstats()' to 
compute the statistic.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">reh_tie &lt;- remify::remify(history, model = "tie")
effects &lt;- ~ reciprocity()
remstats(reh = reh_tie, tie_effects = effects)

reh_actor &lt;- remify::remify(history, model = "actor")
remstats(reh = reh_actor, receiver_effects = effects)
