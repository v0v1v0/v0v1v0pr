<h2>Analysis Results Multi-Arm Fisher</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Class for multi-arm analysis results based on a Fisher combination test design.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This object cannot be created directly; use <code>getAnalysisResults</code>
with suitable arguments to create the multi-arm analysis results of a Fisher combination test design.
</p>


<h3>Fields</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>normalApproximation</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Describes if a normal approximation was used when calculating p-values. Default for means is <code>FALSE</code> and <code>TRUE</code> for rates and hazard ratio. Is a logical vector of length 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>directionUpper</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the direction of the alternative, only applicable for one-sided testing. Default is <code>TRUE</code> which means that larger values of the test statistics yield smaller p-values. Is a logical vector of length 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>thetaH0</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The difference or assumed effect under H0. Is a numeric vector of length 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>pi1</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The assumed probability or probabilities in the active treatment group in two-group designs, or the alternative probability for a one-group design.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>pi2</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The assumed probability in the reference group for two-group designs. Is a numeric vector of length 1 containing a value between 0 and 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>nPlanned</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The sample size planned for each of the subsequent stages. Is a numeric vector of length <code>kMax</code> containing whole numbers.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>allocationRatioPlanned</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The planned allocation ratio (<code>n1 / n2</code>) for the groups. For multi-arm designs, it is the allocation ratio relating the active arm(s) to the control. Is a positive numeric vector of length 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>thetaH1</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The assumed effect under the alternative hypothesis. For survival designs, refers to the hazard ratio. Is a numeric vector.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>assumedStDevs</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Assumed standard deviations to calculate conditional power in multi-arm trials or enrichment designs. Is a numeric vector.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>piTreatments</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The assumed rates in the treatment groups for multi-arm and enrichment designs, i.e., designs with multiple subsets.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>intersectionTest</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The multiple test used for intersection hypotheses in closed systems of hypotheses. Is a character vector of length 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>varianceOption</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines the way to calculate the variance in multiple (i.e., &gt;2) treatment arms or population enrichment designs when testing means. Available options for multiple arms: <code>"overallPooled", "pairwisePooled", "notPooled"</code>. Available options for enrichment designs: <code>"pooled", "pooledFromFull", "notPooled"</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>conditionalRejectionProbabilities</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The probabilities of rejecting the null hypothesis at each stage, given the stage has been reached. Is a numeric vector of length <code>kMax</code> containing values between 0 and 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>conditionalPower</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The conditional power at each stage of the trial. Is a numeric vector of length 1 containing a value between 0 and 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>repeatedConfidenceIntervalLowerBounds</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The lower bound of the confidence intervals that are calculated at any stage of the trial. Is a numeric vector of length <code>kMax</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>repeatedConfidenceIntervalUpperBounds</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The upper bound of the confidence interval that are calculated at any stage of the trial. Is a numeric vector of length <code>kMax</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>repeatedPValues</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The p-values that are calculated at any stage of the trial. Is a numeric vector of length <code>kMax</code> containing values between 0 and 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>piControl</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The assumed probability in the control arm for simulation and under which the sample size recalculation is performed. Is a numeric vector of length 1 containing a value between 0 and 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>conditionalPowerSimulated</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The simulated conditional power, under the assumption of observed or assumed effect sizes.</p>
