<h2>Data on Coronary Artery Disease</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data includes 294 patients undergoing angiography at the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology in Budapest between 1983 and 1987.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 294 observations, ten covariates and one two-class outcome variable
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The variables are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>age</code>. numeric. Age in years
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>sex</code>. factor. Sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>chest_pain</code>. factor. Chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 4 = asymptomatic)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>trestbps</code>. numeric. Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>chol</code>. numeric. Serum cholestoral in mg/dl
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>fbs</code>. factor. Fasting blood sugar &gt; 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>restecg</code>. factor. Resting electrocardiographic results (1 = having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of &gt; 0.05 mV); 0 = normal)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>thalach</code>. numeric. Maximum heart rate achieved
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>exang</code>. factor. Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>oldpeak</code>. numeric. ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Class</code>. factor. Disease satus (1 = no disease; 2 = coronary artery disease)
</p>
</li>
</ul>

The original openML dataset was pre-processed in the following way: <br></p>
<p>1. The variables were re-named according to the description given on openML.
</p>
<p>2. The missing values which were coded as "-9" were replaced by NA values.
</p>
<p>3. The variables <code>slope</code>, <code>ca</code>, and <code>thal</code> were excluded, because these featured
too many missing values.
</p>
<p>4. The categorical covariates were transformed into factors.
</p>
<p>5. There were 6 <code>restecg</code> values of "2" which were replaced by "1".
</p>
<p>6. The missing values were imputed: The missing values of the numerical covariates were replaced by the means
of the corresponding non-missing values. The missing values of the categorical covariates were replaced by
the modes of the corresponding non-missing values.
</p>
<p>Note that this dataset is also included in a slightly different form in the R package <code>ordinalForest</code> (version 2.4-2)
under the name <code>hearth</code>. The only difference is that in <code>hearth2</code>, the ordinal outcome variable
<code>Class</code> was transformed into a two-class outcome by only differentiating between diseased vs. healthy,
rather than differentiating between different levels of disease severity.
