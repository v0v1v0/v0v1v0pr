<h2>Insert, extract, and print text "reminders"</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>remindR is a simple package to insert, extract, and print text
"reminders" either in source code comments or as the "comment" attribute of
any R object.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The primary intent is to allow addition and retrieval of informal
text notes to oneself or collaborators during code development. These could
be reminders about argument requirements, changes or additions to make, the
structure of the function's returned value, required options settings, etc.
â€“ basically anything that one wants to note. Generally such reminders will
be ephemeral and brief. They are not intended as detailed development
specifications.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to use such notes as minimal help "tooltips" for users.
To facilitate this, the <code>"remind&lt;-"</code> insertion and <code>remind</code>
extraction functions wrap R's <code>comment</code> functionality to use the
<code>"comment"</code> attribute of any R object as a list of reminders.
