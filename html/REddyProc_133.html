<h2>globalDummyVars</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Dummy global variables with the same name as fields in R5 classes have been defined.
</p>
<p>Reason: Class methods have been defined as plain functions, so that they can be better documented.
However, the assignment operator <code>&lt;&lt;-</code> has no meaning in it and therefore R CMD check complains.
As a workaround they have been defined as global variable. Do not use them.
