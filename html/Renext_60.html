<h2>Probability that the Greenwood's statistic is smaller than one</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Probability that the Greenwood's statistic is smaller than one.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> 
   pGreenwood1(n)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>Sample size.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The probability was computed by using the approximation of the
quantile function of the Greenwood's statistic returned by
<code>qStat</code>. The result is found by interpolating the
distribution function for <code class="reqn">x = 1</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Probability that the Greenwood's statistic is smaller than one. For a
random sample of an exponential distribution with size <code class="reqn">n</code>, this
is the probability that the coefficient of variation is less than one,
or the probability that the ML estimate of the GPD shape parameter
<code class="reqn">\xi</code> is negative.
