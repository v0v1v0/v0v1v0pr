<h2>The <code>rle</code> Package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Common <code>base</code> and <code>stats</code>
methods for <code>rle</code> objects, aiming to make it possible to treat
them transparently as vectors.
</p>


<h3>History</h3>

<p>This package grew out of the needs of the <code>ergm</code> package for a
run-length encoded representation of extremely long vectors with a
small number of contiguous runs, and these functions were originally
implemented in the <code>statnet.common</code> package.
</p>
<p>It has been split out into its own package to enable others to use
this functionality without installing any unnecessary dependencies
and to facilitate contributions under a simplified license.
</p>


<h3>What works and what doesn't</h3>

<p>The long-run aim of this package is to make it possible to treat
<code>rle</code> objects transparently as unnamed vectors. As of this
writing, the biggest unimplemented feature are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The indexing (<code>[</code> and <code>[[</code>) operators. It is not possible to
extract or replace individual elements of the vector represented
by an <code>rle</code> object, though it is possible to access its
underlying representation (i.e., <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$lenths⁠</code> and <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$values⁠</code>) by
name using any of the above operators or the <code>$</code> operator.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Method <code>rep.rle</code> currently has limited functionality.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
