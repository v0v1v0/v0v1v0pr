<h2>Report of Missing Values</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns a data frame of subject events with missing values.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">missingSummary(rcon, excludeMissingForms = TRUE, ...)

## S3 method for class 'redcapApiConnection'
missingSummary(rcon, excludeMissingForms = TRUE, ...)

missingSummary_offline(records, meta_data, excludeMissingForms = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rcon</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>redcapConnection</code> object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>excludeMissingForms</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>logical(1)</code> When <code>TRUE</code>, forms where all
fields are missing are assumed to be deliberately missing data and
are excluded from the count of missing values. An example when this is
desirable is if a patient did not experience an adverse event;
the adverse event form would contain no data and the empty fields
should not be considered missing data.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>additional arguments passed to inner call of exportRecordsTyped.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>records</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>character(1)</code> A filename pointing to the raw records
download from REDCap.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>meta_data</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>character(1)</code> A filename pointing to the data dictionary
download from REDCap.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The intention of this function is to generate a list of subject
events that are missing and could potentially be values that should have
been entered.
</p>
<p>The branching logic from the data dictionary is parsed and translated into
and R expression.  When a field with branching logic passes the logical
statement, it is evaluated with <code>is.na</code>, otherwise, it is set to
<code>FALSE</code> (non-missing, because there was never an opportunity to
provide a value).  The utility of this function is limited to simple
logic where all of the
data exist within the same row. Any complex statements using events
will result in a failure.
</p>
<p>Optionally, forms that are entirely missing can be determined to be
non-missing.  This is applicable when, for instance, a patient did not
have an adverse event.  In this case, a form dedicated to adverse events
would contain meaningless missing values and could be excluded from the
report.
