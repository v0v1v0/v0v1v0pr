<h2>Group rule pack</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Group rule pack is a rule pack which defines a set of rules
for groups of rows as a whole, i.e. functions which convert groups of
interest to logical values. It should return a data frame with the following
properties:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> There should be present some columns which combined values <strong>uniquely</strong>
describe group. They should be defined during creation with
group_packs().
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Number of rows equals to <strong>number of checked groups</strong>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Names of non-grouping columns should be treated as <strong>rule names</strong>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Values indicate whether the <strong>group as a whole</strong> follows the rule.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This format is inspired by <code>dplyr</code>'s summarise() applied
to grouped data.
</p>
<p>The most common way to define data pack is by creating a
functional sequence with grouping and ending with
<code>summarise(...)</code>.
</p>


<h3>Interpretation</h3>

<p>Group pack output is interpreted in the following way:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> All grouping columns are united with delimiter <code>.group_sep</code>
(which is an argument of <code>group_packs()</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Levels of the resulting column are treated as names of some new variables
which should be exposed as a whole. Names of non-grouping columns are treated
as rule names. They are transformed in column pack format and
interpreted accordingly.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Exposure result of group pack is different from others in a way that column
<code>var</code> in exposure report doesn't represent the actual column
in data.

<pre><code class="language-R">vs_am_rules &lt;- . %&gt;%

  )

group_packs(vs_am = vs_am_rules, .group_vars = c("vs", "am"))
