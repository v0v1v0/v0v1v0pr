<dd>
<p>The seed used for random number generation. Is a numeric vector of length 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>allocationRatioPlanned</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The planned allocation ratio (<code>n1 / n2</code>) for the groups. For multi-arm designs, it is the allocation ratio relating the active arm(s) to the control. Is a positive numeric vector of length 1.</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>The conditional power at each stage of the trial. Is a numeric vector of length 1 containing a value between 0 and 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>iterations</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of iterations used for simulations. Is a numeric vector of length 1 containing a whole number.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>futilityPerStage</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The per-stage probabilities of stopping the trial for futility. Is a numeric matrix.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>futilityStop</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>In simulation results data set: indicates whether trial is stopped for futility or not.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>directionUpper</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the direction of the alternative, only applicable for one-sided testing. Default is <code>TRUE</code> which means that larger values of the test statistics yield smaller p-values. Is a logical vector of length 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>plannedSubjects</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Determines the number of cumulated (overall) subjects when the interim stages are planned. For two treatment arms, is the number of subjects for both treatment arms. For multi-arm designs, refers to the number of subjects per selected active arm. Is a numeric vector of length <code>kMax</code> containing whole numbers.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>minNumberOfSubjectsPerStage</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Determines the minimum number of subjects per stage for data-driven sample size recalculation. For two treatment arms, is the number of subjects for both treatment arms. For multi-arm designs, is the minimum number of subjects per selected active arm. Is a numeric vector of length <code>kMax</code> containing whole numbers.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>maxNumberOfSubjectsPerStage</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Determines the maximum number of subjects per stage for data-driven sample size recalculation. For two treatment arms, is the number of subjects for both treatment arms. For multi-arm designs, is the minimum number of subjects per selected active arm. Is a numeric vector of length <code>kMax</code> containing whole numbers.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>calcSubjectsFunction</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>An optional function that can be entered to define how sample size is recalculated. By default, recalculation is performed with conditional power with specified <code>minNumberOfSubjectsPerStage</code> and <code>maxNumberOfSubjectsPerStage</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>expectedNumberOfSubjects</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The expected number of subjects under specified alternative.</p>

<dd>
<p>The multiple test used for intersection hypotheses in closed systems of hypotheses. Is a character vector of length 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>stratifiedAnalysis</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>For enrichment designs, typically a stratified analysis should be chosen. When testing means and rates, a non-stratified analysis can be performed on overall data. For survival data, only a stratified analysis is possible. Is a logical vector of length 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>adaptations</code></dt>
<dd>
