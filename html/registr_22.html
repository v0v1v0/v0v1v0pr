<h2>Berkeley Growth Study data with simulated incompleteness</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset from the Berkeley Growth Study comprises the height
development of 39 boys and 54 girls between ages 1 and 18.
It is based on the dataset <code>fda::growth</code> and focuses not on the observed
heights, but on the first derivatives of the curves. Before taking the
first derivative, the curves were slightly smoothed. <br><br>
To showcase the functionality of the <code>registr</code> package regarding the
analysis of incomplete curves, the growth curves were artificially made
incomplete. For each child, leading incompleteness was simulated by drawing
a random initial age in the first quarter of the domain.
Also, trailing incompleteness was simulated by drawing
a random cut-off age in the second half of the domain.
