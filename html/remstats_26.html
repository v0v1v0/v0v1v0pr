<h2>itp</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Specifies the statistic for an incoming two-path effect.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">itp(unique = FALSE, scaling = c("none", "std"), consider_type = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>unique</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value indicating whether to sum the minimum of
events with third actors (FALSE, default) or the number of third actors that
create a new, unique two-path (TRUE). See details for more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scaling</code></td>
<td>
<p>The method for scaling the triad statistic. The default value
is "none", which means the statistic is not scaled. Alternatively, you can
set it to "std" to request standardization of the raw counts per time point.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>consider_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value indicating whether to count the
two-paths separately for each event type (TRUE, default) or sum across
different event types (FALSE).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The incoming two-path effect describes the propensity of dyads to interact
based on the number of past incoming two-paths between them. By default, the
statistic at timepoint t for the dyad (i,j) is computed as the sum of the
minimum occurrences of past (j,h) and (h,i) events across all actors h.
</p>
<p>When the unique parameter is set to TRUE, a different approach is taken.
In this case, the statistic counts the number of actors h that contribute to
the creation of a new, distinct two-path between actors i and j.
</p>
<p>Additionally, it is possible to specify a scaling method using the scaling
parameter.
</p>
<p>Please note that the incoming two-path effect, 'itp', is exclusively defined
for directed events.
