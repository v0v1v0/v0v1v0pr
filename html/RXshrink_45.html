<h2>Ty Cobb batting statistics for 1905–1928 with Carl Morris' 2-piece Spline term.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Linear Regression models can be used to predict Ty Cobb's Expected true
yearly batting averages from his observed yearly "batavg" and the 5 other variables
stored in the "tycobb" data.frame. Predictions from such "models" can address the
question: "Was Ty Cobb ever a TRUE .400 hitter?" Since a player's seasonal batavg
is a "random variable," the fact that Cobb's batavg was 0.4196 in 1911 and 0.4105
in 1912 does not necessarily imply that his Expected Seasonal batavg was truly
over .400 in either of those consecutive seasons. For example, his batavg was 0.4011
in 1922 (10 years later). However, his seasonal batavg had dipped to "only" 0.3341
in 1920.

<p>"Cobb lived off the field as though he wished to live forever. He lived on the field
as though it was his last day." – Branch Rickey, Major League Baseball Hall of Fame
executive.
