<h2>a vector that gives a desired sort order of the chinook collections</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is just an example of what one would use as levels in order to
get the <code>chinook</code> collections in a desired sort order after
analysis.  The issue here is collection in the input data frame to most
functions must be a character vector, not a factor.  But, after analysis
you can always make them a factor again and use a vector like this
one to specify the levels.
