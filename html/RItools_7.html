<h2>CovsAlignedToADesign S4 class</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A class for representing covariate matrices after alignment within stratum,
for a (single) given stratifying factor.  There can also be a clustering variable,
assumed to be nested within the stratifying variable.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In contrast to DesignOptions, this class represents the combination of a single Covariates
table, realized treatment assignment and treatment assignment scheme, not multiple treatment
assignment schemes (designs). These Covariates are assumed to reflect regularization, s.t.
missings have been patched with a value and then all of the covariate values have been aligned
within each stratum.  In lieu of a NotMissing slot there will be Covariates columns, also
centered within a stratum, recording
non-missingness of the original data.
</p>
<p>Ordinarily the StrataWeightRatio slot has an entry for each unit, representing ratio of
specified stratum weight to the product of <code class="reqn">h_b</code> (the harmonic mean of <code class="reqn">n_\{tb\}</code> and
<code class="reqn">n_{cb}</code>, the counts of treatment and control clusters in stratum <code class="reqn">b</code>) with <code class="reqn">bar-w_b</code>,
(the arithmetic mean of aggregated cluster weights within that stratum). It can also
be the numeric vector 1, without names, meaning the intended weight ratio is always 1.
</p>
