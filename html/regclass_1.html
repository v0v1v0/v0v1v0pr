<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Who is more likely to open a new type of account that a bank wants to try to sell its customers?  Try logistic regression or partition models to see if you can develop a model that accurately classifies purchasers vs. non-purchasers.  Or, try to develop a model that does well in promoting to nearly all customers who would buy the account.
