<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>perfect</code> provides a sample of simulated data that were developed to analyze variability and sensitivity of <code>FPM</code>.
Simulated datasets (n=1000) were originally developed for the analyses; <code>perfect</code> is a single example realization of the simulation.
Simulations were generated using the covariance matrix of <code>h.northport</code> sediment chemical concentrations and the
<code>rmvnorm</code> function from the <code>splus2R</code> package (Constantine and Hesterberg 2021). The <code>Hit</code> values were generated with <code>toxCRM</code>
using simulated concentrations of <code>Cr</code>, <code>Cu</code>, <code>Fe</code>, and <code>Zn</code>
as inputs. The inputs to <code>toxCRM</code> were based on empirical toxicity ranges (minimum and maximum effect levels) as well as
arbitrarily based on probable effect concentration (PEC) and threshold effect concentration (TEC) values from MacDonald et al (2000). Inflection points were
set equal to PECs, and steepnesses were set as the ratio of the PEC to the TEC.
Fe inputs were arbitrary chosen to reflect its low toxicity relative to Cr, Cu, and Zn (e.g., high inflection point and relatively low steepness).
The median toxicity output (for the 4 chemicals) was compared to a threshold of 75% with <code>Hit == TRUE</code> assigned to values below that level and
<code>Hit == FALSE</code> assigned to values &gt;=75%.
