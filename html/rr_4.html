<h2>Power Analysis Plot for Randomized Response</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>power.rr.plot</code> generates a power analysis plot for randomized response
survey designs.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">power.rr.plot(p, p0, p1, q, design, n.seq, r, presp.seq, presp.null =
NULL, sig.level, prespT.seq, prespC.seq, prespT.null = NULL, prespC.null,
type = c("one.sample", "two.sample"), alternative = c("one.sided",
"two.sided"), solve.tolerance = .Machine$double.eps, legend = TRUE, legend.x
= "bottomright", legend.y, par = TRUE, ...)

<td>
<p>For the modified designs only (i.e. "forced-unknown" for Forced
Response with Unknown Probability and "unrelated-unknown" for Unrelated
Question with Unknown Probability), <code>r</code> is the proportion of

directed to answer the sensitive question truthfully with probability

sensitive question truthfully with probability <code>1-p</code>.</p>

<td><code>prespT.null</code></td>
<td>
<p>For a two sample test, the probability of the treated
group possessing the sensitive trait under the null hypothesis. The default
is <code>NULL</code> meaning there is no difference between the treated and

sensitive trait under the null hypothesis.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function generates a power analysis plot for randomized response survey
designs, both for the standard designs ("forced-known", "mirrored",
"disguised", "unrelated-known") and modified designs ("forced-unknown", and
"unrelated -unknown"). The x-axis shows the population proportions with the
sensitive trait; the y-axis shows the statistical power; and different
sample sizes are shown as different lines in grayscale.
</p>
