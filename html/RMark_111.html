<h2>Provides a summary for the capture histories</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For each release (initial capture) cohort, the number of recaptured
(resighted) individuals from that cohort is tallied for each of the
following occasions.  A summary table with number released (initially
caught) and the number recaptured is given for each group if
<code>bygroup=TRUE</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">summary_ch(x, bygroup = TRUE, marray = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Processed data list; resulting value from process.data</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bygroup</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE, summary tables are created for each group defined in
the data</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>marray</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE, summary tables are m-arrays as in MARK</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>list of dataframes (one for each group in the data); each dataframe
has rows for each release cohort and columns for each recapture occasion.
The rows and columns are labelled with the occasion time labels.  If
<code>marray==FALSE</code> the first column is the number initially released and
the remaining columns (one for each recapture/resighting occasion) are the
number recaught in each of the following occasions and the number caught in
at least one of the occasions.  If <code>marray==TRUE</code> the first column is
the number released which includes those initially released and ones
released after recapture from a previous cohort. The remaining columns are
the number first recaught in each of the following occasions.  Once
re-caught they become one of the following rows (ie release-recap pairs)
unless it is the last time they were captured and they were not released (eg
negative frequency).
