<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package is an R implementation of the python script <code>marineHeatWaves</code>
(<a href="https://github.com/ecjoliver/marineHeatWaves">https://github.com/ecjoliver/marineHeatWaves</a>) written by Eric C. J.
Oliver as part of the marine heat waves definition by Hobday et al. (2016).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Although the title of the package refers to marine heat waves (MHW),
it is equally capable of detecting marine cold spells (MCS). This
functionality to detect cold events is also present in the python package,
where it was implemented as a result of the publication Schlegel et al. (2017)
that discusses the quantification and detection of anomalously cold events.
As of release 0.16.0, the detect function may also be applied to time series
of other natural phenomena which one might want to express in terms of the
summary metrics outlined in the paper by Hobday et al. (2016).
</p>
<p>The main function is the detection function <code>detect</code> which takes as
input a time series of temperature (and a corresponding series of dates)
and outputs a set of detected MHWs or MCS, as well as the climatological
(varying by day-of-year) seasonal cycle and extremes threshold. There are
various helper functions to fascilitate developing an uninterrupted time
series of temperatures (e.g. <code>make_whole</code>) and some options to produce
graphical summaries and representations of the detected events such as
<code>event_line</code> and <code>lolli_plot</code>, or the ggplot2
equivalents, <code>geom_flame</code> and <code>geom_lolli</code>.
</p>
<p>This package is demonstrated by applying the MHW definition to observed SST
records and showing how it identifies three historical MHWs: the 2011
Western Australia event, the 2012 Northwest Atlantic event and the 2003
Mediterranean event. These data are included herewith.
</p>
<p>One may also use the <code>exceedance</code> function to calculate consecutive
days above or below a given static threshold. The output of this function is
similar to <code>detect</code>.
