<h2>Examples for the deprecated Rcpp R/C++ Interface library API</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package shows some simple examples for the use of the deprecated
<em>classic</em> API from the first implementation of <span class="pkg">Rcpp</span>. 
</p>
<p>Note that the <span class="pkg">RcppClassic</span> package has been deprecated since
2010, all new development should use the <span class="pkg">Rcpp</span> package instead.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">Rcpp</span> package provides a number of C++ classes that ease
access to C++ from R. This comprises both passing parameters to
functions, as well as returning results back from C++ to R.
</p>
<p>Two APIs are supported. The first is an older API which was first
introduced mostly in 2006 and extended in 2008. This interface is used
by a few other packages and will be supported going forward in the
RcppClassic-package package.
</p>
<p>A second and newer API that was started in 2009 offers more
functionality, see the Rcpp-package package.
</p>
<p>The <span class="pkg">RcppExamples</span> package provides some simple examples for use
of <span class="pkg">Rcpp</span>.
</p>


<h3>Author(s)</h3>

<p>Dominick Samperi wrote the initial versions of Rcpp (and
RcppTemplate) during 2005 and 2006.  Dirk Eddelbuettel made some
additions, and became maintainer in 2008. Dirk Eddelbuettel and Romain
Francois have been extending Rcpp since 2009.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>See the RcppExamples-package for examples of the
recommended <span class="pkg">Rcpp</span> API and Rcpp-package for
documentation on the recommended API to extend R with C++ code, while
the deprecated RcppClassic-package documents the
older, deprecated API.
