Bike sharing data.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is the Bike Sharing dataset (day records only) from the UC Irvine
Machine Learning Dataset Repository.  Included here with 
permission of Dr. Hadi Fanaee.  
</p>
<p>The <code>day</code> data is as on UCI; <code>day1</code> is modified so that the
numeric weather variables are on their original scale.
</p>
<p>The <code>day2</code> is the same as <code>day1</code>, except that <code>dteday</code>
has been removed, and <code>season</code>, <code>mnth</code>, <code>weekday</code> and
<code>weathersit</code> have been converted to R factors.
</p>
