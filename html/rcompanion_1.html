<h2>Functions to Support Extension Education Program Evaluation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions and datasets to support Summary and Analysis of
Extension Program Evaluation in R and An R
Companion for the Handbook of Biological Statistics.
</p>


<h3>Useful functions</h3>

<p>There are several functions that provide summary statistics for
grouped data. These function titles tend to start with <code>"groupwise"</code>.
They provide means, medians, geometric means, and Huber M-estimators
for groups, along with confidence intervals by traditional
methods and bootstrap.
</p>
<p>Functions to produce effect size statistics, 
some with bootstrapped confidence intervals, 
include those for Cramer's V, 
Cohen's g and odds ratio for paired tables, Cohen's h, 
Cohen's w, Vargha and Delaney's A, Cliff's delta,
r for one-sample, two-sample, and paired Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests, 
epsilon-squared, and Freeman's theta. 
</p>
<p>The <code>accuracy</code> function
reports statistics for
models including minimum maximum accuracy, MAPE, RMSE, 
Efron's pseudo r-squared, and coefficient of variation.
</p>
<p>The functions <code>nagelkerke</code> and <code>efronRSquared</code>
provide pseudo R-squared values for a variety of model types, as well as
a likelihood ratio test for the model as a whole.
</p>
<p>There are also functions that are useful for comparing models.
<code>compareLM</code>,  <code>compareGLM</code>, and 
<code>pairwiseModelAnova</code>.
These use goodness-of-fit measures like AIC, BIC, and BICc, or likelihood
ratio tests. 
</p>
<p>Functions for nominal data include post-hoc tests for 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (<code>groupwiseCMH</code>),
for McNemar-Bowker test (<code>pairwiseMcnemar</code>),
and for tests of association like Chi-square, Fisher exact, and G-test
(<code>pairwiseNominalIndependence</code>).
</p>
<p>There are a few useful plotting functions, including 
<code>plotNormalHistogram</code> that plots a histogram of values and 
overlays
a normal curve, and <code>plotPredy</code> which plots of line for predicted
values for a bivariate model.  Other plotting functions include producing
density plots.
</p>
<p>A function close to my heart is <code>cateNelson</code>, which performs
Cate-Nelson analysis for bivariate data.
</p>


<h3>Vignettes and examples</h3>

<p>The functions in this package are used in
"Extension Education Program Evaluation in R" which is available at
<a href="https://rcompanion.org/handbook/">https://rcompanion.org/handbook/</a>
and "An R Companion for the Handbook of Biological Statistics" 
which is available at <a href="https://rcompanion.org/rcompanion/">https://rcompanion.org/rcompanion/</a>.
</p>
<p>The documentation for each function includes an example as well.
</p>


<h3>Version notes</h3>

<p>Version 2.0 is not entirely back-compatible
as several functions have been removed.
These include some of the pairwise methods that can be replaced with
better methods.  Also, some functions have been removed or modified
in order to import fewer packages.
</p>
<p>Removed packages are indicated with 'Defunct' in their titles.
