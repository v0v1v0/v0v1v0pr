<h2>Perform relatives simulations using large memory blocks in C</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generate N pairs with a given relationship, calculate the LR for sibs,
parent-child and the number of matching alleles and count the number of
pairs that meet the threshold criteria.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">blockSim(
  N,
  Freqs,
  rel = "UN",
  ibsthresh = NULL,
  kithresh = NULL,
  code = 1,
  falseNeg = TRUE,
  BlockSize = N/10,
  showProgress = FALSE
)
</code></pre>

<p>A vector of one or more IBS thresholds</p>

<li>
<p> the LR for siblings and the number of matching alleles will be
compared to the values in <code>kithresh</code> and <code>ibsthresh</code> and
incremented if both the LR and IBS is greater than the thresholds.

to work </p>

<td><code>falseNeg</code></td>

<p>if TRUE then the number of results that DO NOT satisfy the
conditions are counted, otherwise the number of results DO satisfy the
conditions are counted</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>BlockSize</code></td>
<td>
<p>Sets the number of random profiles to be generated in each
iteration. By default the block size is set to 10 percent of the total
sample size. It is unclear whether the procedure is more efficient if a
bigger percentage of the total is used. Users must take care to make sure
that the block size evenly divides <code>N</code> otherwise the procedure will
exit. Users must also make sure that they have enough memory.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is used for fast accurate estimation of false positive and
false negative rates. It achieves part of its speed by block exectution in
C, and part by not saving the LR or IBS results. It can do 1 billion
iterations in about an hour.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector containing the number of profile pairs that satisfied the
threshold conditions

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
## not run
## this counts the number of unrelated pairs that are falsely identified
## as siblings using the policy that there are 16 or more matching
## alleles, and the LR/KI is greater than 100,000
## this is a very rare event for the FBI Caucasians with a frequency of
## about 4-5 times in 10 million pairs
## Not run: 
data(fbiCaucs)
N = 1e8
ki = 1e5
ibs = 16
code = 5
BlockSize = 1e6
blockSim(N, fbiCaucs, rel = "UN", ibsthresh = ibs, kithresh = ki,
         code = code, falseNeg = FALSE, BlockSize = BlockSize)

## End(Not run)
