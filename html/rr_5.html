<h2>Power Analysis for Randomized Response</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>power.rr.test</code> is used to conduct power analysis for randomized
response survey designs.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">power.rr.test(p, p0, p1, q, design, n = NULL, r, presp, presp.null =
NULL, sig.level, prespT, prespC, prespT.null = NULL, prespC.null, power =
NULL, type = c("one.sample", "two.sample"), alternative = c("one.sided",
"two.sided"), solve.tolerance = .Machine$double.eps)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p</code></td>
<td>
<p>The probability of receiving the sensitive question (Mirrored
Question Design, Unrelated Question Design); the probability of answering
truthfully (Forced Response Design); the probability of selecting a red card
from the 'yes' stack (Disguised Response Design).</p>

<p>The probability of forced 'no' (Forced Response Design).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p1</code></td>
<td>
<p>The probability of forced 'yes' (Forced Response Design).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>q</code></td>
<td>
<p>The probability of answering 'yes' to the unrelated question, which
is assumed to be independent of covariates (Unrelated Question Design).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>design</code></td>
<td>
<p>Call of design (including modified designs) used:
"forced-known", "mirrored", "disguised", "unrelated-known",
"forced-unknown", and "unrelated-unknown".</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of observations. Exactly one of 'n' or 'power' must be NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>r</code></td>
<td>
<p>For the modified designs only (i.e. "forced-unknown" for Forced
Response with Unknown Probability and "unrelated-unknown" for Unrelated
Question with Unknown Probability), <code>r</code> is the proportion of
respondents allocated to the first group, which is the group that is
directed to answer the sensitive question truthfully with probability
<code>p</code> as opposed to the second group which is directed to answer the
sensitive question truthfully with probability <code>1-p</code>.</p>
</td>

<td>
<p>For a one sample test, the probability of possessing the
sensitive trait under the alternative hypothesis.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>presp.null</code></td>
<td>
<p>For a one sample test, the probability of possessing the
sensitive trait under the null hypothesis. The default is <code>NULL</code>
meaning zero probability of possessing the sensitive trait.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sig.level</code></td>
<td>
<p>Significance level (Type I error probability).</p>
</td>

possessing the sensitive trait under the alternative hypothesis.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prespT.null</code></td>
<td>
<p>For a two sample test, the probability of the treated
group possessing the sensitive trait under the null hypothesis. The default
is <code>NULL</code> meaning there is no difference between the treated and
control groups, specifically that <code>prespT.null</code> is the same as
<code>prespC.null</code>, the probability of the control group possessing the
sensitive trait under the null hypothesis.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prespC.null</code></td>
<td>
<p>For a two sample test, the probability of the control
group possessing the sensitive trait under the null hypothesis.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>power</code></td>
<td>
<p>Power of test (Type II error probability). Exactly one of 'n'
or 'power' must be NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>One or two sample test. For a two sample test, the alternative
and null hypotheses refer to the difference between the two samples of the

<p>One or two sided test.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function allows users to conduct power analysis for randomized response
survey designs, both for the standard designs ("forced-known", "mirrored",
"disguised", "unrelated-known") and modified designs ("forced-unknown", and
"unrelated -unknown").
</p>

<p><code>power.rr.test</code> contains the following components (the
inclusion of some components such as the design parameters are dependent
upon the design used):
</p>

<p>Point estimates for the effects of covariates on the randomized
response item.</p>
