<h3>Description</h3>

<p>DoubleClick for Publishers API from R
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) API (recently renamed to Google Ad Manager) 
consists of roughly 50 services. Each service is written to handle a particular 
set of operations within the API and grouped.
</p>
<p>The official documentation, provided by Google, is available at:
<a href="https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/rel_notes">https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/rel_notes</a>
</p>
<p>This package attempts to scrape the functionality and documentation from the 
references and WSDL to provide an interface via R. Each function has its own
documentation, but additional material can be found in the 
<a href="https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/rdfp">README</a> on GitHub
