<h2>Convert Rd to roxygen documentation and utilities to enhance documentation
and building packages</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package contains functions to convert Rd to roxygen documentation. It
can parse an Rd file to a list (<code>parse_file</code>), create the roxygen
documentation (<code>create_roxygen</code>) and update the original R script
(e.g. the one containing the definition of the function) accordingly
(<code>Rd2roxygen</code>). This package also provides utilities which can
help developers build packages using roxygen more easily (<code>rab</code>).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>There is no guarantee to generate perfect roxygen comments that can be
converted back to the original Rd files. Usually manual manipulations on
the roxygen comments are required. For example, currently '@S3method' is
not included in the comments, and '@rdname' is not supported either (users
have to move the roxygen comments around and add the appropriate tags by
themselves). Patches (as pull requests) are welcome through GitHub:
<a href="https://github.com/yihui/Rd2roxygen/">https://github.com/yihui/Rd2roxygen/</a>.
</p>
<p>This package is not thoroughly tested, so it is likely that it fails to
convert certain parts of Rd files to roxygen comments. As mentioned before,
you have to manually deal with these problems. You are welcome to report
other serious issues via <a href="https://github.com/yihui/Rd2roxygen/issues">https://github.com/yihui/Rd2roxygen/issues</a>.
