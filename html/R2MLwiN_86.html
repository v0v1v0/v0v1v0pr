<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The simulated <code>wage1</code> dataset is one of the sample datasets provided
with the multilevel modelling software package MLwiN (Rasbash et al., 2009),
and described in Browne (2012). It consists of salary and associated
information for office workers, and is used by Browne (2012) as an example
of modelling a multiple membership structure. The dataset exhibits multiple
membership in that workers are clustered across the companies employing them
over the past year, but some have worked for more than one company during
that time.)
