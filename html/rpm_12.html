<h2>Faux Data on Heterosexual Matching</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set represents a simulation of a bipartite matching.
The data set is named fauxmatching.
Its primary use is to illustrate the fitting of a Revealed Preference Matchings Model (rpm).
The model assumes a one-to-one stable matching using an observed set of
matchings and a set of (possibly dyadic) covariates to 
estimate the parameters for
linear equations of utilities. This provides such data
for a matching between men and women of certain
characteristics (or shared characteristics) of people of the opposite sex.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(fauxmatching)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>fauxmatching</code> is a list containing a pair of <code>data.frame</code> objects: <code>Xdata</code> and <code>Zdata</code>.
</p>
<p><code>Xdata</code> is for women. Each row is a woman, each column is a variable on that women
or her partnerships. The women's ID variable s called <code>pid</code> and
the variable with the ID of the women's partner is called <code>pair_id</code>. If the women is single the men's ID is NA.
<code>Zdata</code> is for men. Each row is a man, each column is a variable on that men
The men's ID variable is called <code>pid</code>.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>pair_id</dt>
<dd>
<p> The ID of the person's partner. This is in both <code>Xdata</code> and <code>Zdata</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sampled</dt>
<dd>
<p> The indicator that the person was sampled directly (as distinct from being included as the match of a directly sampled
person. All single people are directly sampled.  This is in both <code>Xdata</code> and <code>Zdata</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The pairings are determined by the <code>pair_id</code> variable in <code>Xdata</code>. 
If that variable is NA then the women is
assumed to be single. If men are listed in <code>Zdata</code> and are not partnered then they are assumed single.
Weights are specified by three optional variables in <code>Xdata</code>.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>X_w</dt>
<dd>
<p>The weight variable for women. The sum of the weights of the sampled women is the
number of women in the population.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Z_w</dt>
<dd>
<p>The weight variable for men. The sum of the weights of the sampled men is the
number of men in the population.</p>
</dd>
<dt>pair_w</dt>
<dd>
<p>The weight variable for pairs.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>No return value, called for side effects.
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The data set is simulation based upon an rpm model fit to data from
the 2008 SIPP.
