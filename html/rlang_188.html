<h2>Format bullets for error messages</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>format_error_bullets()</code> takes a character vector and returns a single
string (or an empty vector if the input is empty). The elements of
the input vector are assembled as a list of bullets, depending on
their names:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Unnamed elements are unindented. They act as titles or subtitles.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Elements named <code>"*"</code> are bulleted with a cyan "bullet" symbol.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Elements named <code>"i"</code> are bulleted with a blue "info" symbol.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Elements named <code>"x"</code> are bulleted with a red "cross" symbol.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Elements named <code>"v"</code> are bulleted with a green "tick" symbol.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Elements named <code>"!"</code> are bulleted with a yellow "warning" symbol.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Elements named <code>"&gt;"</code> are bulleted with an "arrow" symbol.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Elements named <code>" "</code> start with an indented line break.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For convenience, if the vector is fully unnamed, the elements are
formatted as "*" bullets.
</p>
<p>The bullet formatting for errors follows the idea that sentences in
error messages are best kept short and simple. The best way to
present the information is in the <code>cnd_body()</code> method of an error
conditon as a bullet list of simple sentences containing a single
clause. The info and cross symbols of the bullets provide hints on
how to interpret the bullet relative to the general error issue,
which should be supplied as <code>cnd_header()</code>.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">format_error_bullets(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named character vector of messages. Named elements are
prefixed with the corresponding bullet. Elements named with a
single space <code>" "</code> trigger a line break from the previous bullet.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># All bullets
writeLines(format_error_bullets(c("foo", "bar")))

# This is equivalent to
writeLines(format_error_bullets(set_names(c("foo", "bar"), "*")))

# Supply named elements to format info, cross, and tick bullets
writeLines(format_error_bullets(c(i = "foo", x = "bar", v = "baz", "*" = "quux")))

# An unnamed element breaks the line
writeLines(format_error_bullets(c(i = "foo\nbar")))

# A " " element breaks the line within a bullet (with indentation)
writeLines(format_error_bullets(c(i = "foo", " " = "bar")))
</code></pre>
