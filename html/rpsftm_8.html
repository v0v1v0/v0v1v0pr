<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulated data to use with the <code>rpsftm</code> function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">immdef
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A simulated data frame with 9 variables and 1000 observations representing a study where participants 
were randomly assigned to receive treatment immediately or deferred. Participants in the deferred 
arm could crossover and receive treatment. The primary endpoint was time to disease progression.
</p>
<p>The data are based on a randomized controlled trial Concorde <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736%2894%2990006-X">doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(94)90006-X</a>
