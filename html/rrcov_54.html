<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Fish Catch data set contains measurements on 159 fish caught in the lake
Laengelmavesi, Finland. For the 159 fishes of 7 species the weight,
length, height, and width were measured. Three different length
measurements are recorded: from the nose of the fish to the
beginning of its tail, from the nose to the notch of its tail and
from the nose to the end of its tail. The height and width are
calculated as percentages of the third length variable. This results
in 6 observed variables, Weight, Length1, Length2, Length3, Height, Width.
Observation 14 has a missing value in variable Weight, therefore
this observation is usually excluded from the analysis. The last
variable, Species, represents the grouping structure: the 7
species are 1=Bream, 2=Whitewish, 3=Roach, 4=Parkki, 5=Smelt,
6=Pike, 7=Perch. This data set was also analyzed in the context 
of robust Linear Discriminant Analysis by Todorov (2007), 
Todorov and Pires (2007).
