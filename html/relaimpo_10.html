<h2> Function to calculate relative importance metrics for linear models </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>calc.relimp calculates several relative importance metrics for the linear model. 
The recommended metrics are <code>lmg</code> (<code class="reqn">R^2</code> partitioned by averaging over orders, like in Lindemann, Merenda and Gold (1980, p.119ff)) 
and <code>pmvd</code> (a newly proposed metric by Feldman (2005) that is provided in the non-US version of the package only). 
For completeness and comparison purposes, several other metrics are also on offer (cf. e.g. Darlington (1968)).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
## generic function
calc.relimp(object, ...)

## default S3 method
## Default S3 method:
calc.relimp(object, x = NULL, ..., 
       type = "lmg", diff = FALSE, rank = TRUE, rela = FALSE, always = NULL, 
       groups = NULL, groupnames = NULL, weights=NULL, design=NULL)

## S3 method for formula object
## S3 method for class 'formula'
calc.relimp(formula, data, weights, na.action, ..., subset=NULL)

## S3 method for objects of class lm
## S3 method for class 'lm'
calc.relimp(object, type = "lmg", groups = NULL, groupnames=NULL, always = NULL, ...)

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object   </code></td>
<td>
<p> The class of this object determines which of the methods is used:
There are special methods for output objects from function <code>lm</code> 
(or linear model objects inheriting from class lm 
generated by other functions like <code>glm</code> and <code>svyglm</code>)
and for formula objects.
For all other types of object, the default method is used.
</p>
<p>Thus, object can be
</p>
<p>a formula (e.g. <code>y~x1+x2+x3+x2:x3</code>) (cf. below for details)
</p>
<p>OR
</p>
<p>the output of a linear model call (inheriting from class <code>lm</code>, but not <code>mlm</code>); 
output objects from <code>lm</code>, <code>glm</code>, <code>svyglm</code> or <code>aov</code> work 
(if linear with identity link in case of glm's);
there may be further functions that output objects inheriting from <code>lm</code> 
which may or may not work reasonably with <code>calc.relimp</code>; 
for <code>calc.relimp</code> to be appropriate, the underlying model must at least be linear!
</p>
<p>The restrictions on usage of interactions listed under item formula below also 
apply to linear model objects. 
</p>
<p>OR 
</p>
<p>the covariance matrix of a response y and regressors x, 
(e.g. obtained by cov(cbind(y,x)), if y is a column vector of response values 
and x a corresponding matrix of regressors) 
</p>
<p>OR 
</p>
<p>a (raw) data matrix or data frame with the response variable in the first column
</p>
<p>OR
</p>
<p>a response vector or one-column matrix, 
if <code>x</code> contains the corresponding matrix or data frame of regressors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula   </code></td>
<td>
<p> The first object, if a formula is to be given; 
one response only. 
</p>
<p>Interaction terms are currently limited to second-order.
</p>
<p>Note: If several interaction terms are given, calculations may be very 
resource intensive, if these are all connected (e.g. with A:B, B:C, C:D, all A,B,C,D are connected, 
while with A:B, C:D, D:E there are separate groups A,B and C,D,E). 
</p>
<p>Interaction terms occurring in always do not increase resource usage 
(but are only permitted if the respective main effects also occur in always).
</p>
<p>Interactions and groups currently cannot be used simultaneously. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x   </code></td>
<td>
<p> a (raw) data matrix or data frame containing the regressors,

<p>OR 
</p>
<p>NULL, if <code>object</code> is anything else </p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type   </code></td>
<td>
<p> can be a character string, character vector or list of character strings.
It is the collection of metrics that are to be calculated. 
Available metrics: <code>lmg</code>, <code>pmvd</code> (non-US version only), <code>last</code>, <code>first</code>, 
<code>betasq</code>, <code>pratt</code>, <code>genizi</code> and <code>car</code>. For brief sketches of their meaning cf. details section. </p>

<p> is a logical requesting relative importances summing to 100% (<code>rela=TRUE</code>). 
If rela is FALSE (default), some of the metrics sum to <code class="reqn">R^2</code> (<code>lmg</code>, <code>pmvd</code>, <code>pratt</code>), 
others do not have a meaningful sum (<code>last</code>, <code>first</code>, <code>betasq</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>always </code></td>
<td>
<p> is a vector of column numbers or names of variables to be always in the 
model (adjusted for). Valid numbers are 2 to (number of regressors + 1) (1 is reserved for the response), 
valid character strings are all column names of <code>object</code> or <code>x</code> respectively 
that refer to regressor variables. Numbers and names cannot be mixed. 
</p>
<p>Relative importance is only assessed for the variables not selected in <code>always</code>. 
</p>
<p>This option currently does not work for metrics <code>genizi</code> and <code>car</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>groups </code></td>
<td>
<p> is a list of vectors of column numbers or names of variables to be combined into groups. 
If only one group is needed, a vector can be given. The numbers and character strings needed are of the same form 
as for <code>always</code>. 
</p>
<p>Relative importance is only allocated between groups of regressors, no subdivision within groups is calculated. 
Regressors that do not occur in any group are included as singletons.
A regressor must not occur in <code>always</code> and in <code>groups</code>. Also, groups cannot be used with a linear model or a formula 
in case of higher order effects (interactions). Finally, <code>groups</code> only works with the four metrics 
<code>lmg</code>, <code>pmvd</code>, <code>last</code> and <code>first</code>.</p>

<td><code>weights </code></td>
<td>
<p> is a vector of case weights for the observations in the data frame (or matrix).
You can EITHER specify <code>weights</code> OR a <code>design</code>.
Note that weights must not be specified for linear model objects (since these should contain their weights as 
part of the model).</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>design </code></td>
<td>
<p> is a design object of class <code>survey.design</code> (cf. package <span class="pkg">survey</span>).
You can EITHER specify a <code>design</code> OR <code>weights</code>. For <code>calc.relimp</code>, the design is used 
for calculating weights only.
Note that it is discouraged (though possible) to specify a design for a conventional linear model object 
(since a survey-specific linear model should be used for survey data, cf. function <code>svyglm</code>). 
</p>
<p>Also note that care is needed when using <code>subset</code> together with <code>design</code>:

<p> if first object is of class formula: 
an optional expression indicating the subset of the observations of <code>data</code> that should be used in the fit. 
This can be a logical vector, or a numeric vector indicating which observation numbers are to be included, 
or a  character  vector of the row names to be included.  All (non-missing) observations are included by
default. </p>

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

(print an error message and terminate if there are any incomplete observations), 
"na.omit" or "na.exclude" (equivalent for package <code>relaimpo</code>, 
both analyse complete cases only and print a warning, this is also what is done the default method ). </p>

</dd>
<dt>car</dt>
<dd>
<p> is the <code class="reqn">R^2</code> decomposition according to Zuber and Strimmer 2010, also available from package <span class="pkg">care</span> 
(squares of scores produced by function <code>carscore</code>
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Each metric is calculated using the internal function “metric”<code>calc</code>, e.g. <code>lmgcalc</code>.
</p>
<p>Five of the metrics in <code>calc.relimp</code> (<code>lmg</code>, <code>pmvd</code>, <code>pratt</code>, <code>genizi</code> and <code>car</code>), 
decompose the model <code class="reqn">R^2</code>. 
<code>calc.relimp</code> (<code>lmg</code>, <code>pmvd</code>, <code>pratt</code>, <code>genizi</code> and <code>car</code>) sum to the <code class="reqn">R^2</code> that is to be decomposed, 
if <code>rela = FALSE</code> and to 100pct if <code>rela = TRUE</code>.
</p>
<p>The other metrics also (artificially) sum to 100pct if <code>rela = TRUE</code>. 
If <code>rela = FALSE</code>, they are given relative to var(y) (or the conditional variance of y after adjusting out the variables 
requested in <code>always</code>) but do not sum to <code class="reqn">R^2</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>always</code> requests some variables to be always in the model, these are conditioned upon 
(i.e. included into the model first). Only the remaining <code class="reqn">R^2</code> that is not explained by 
these variables is decomposed among the other regressors. This currently does not work for metrics <code>genizi</code> and <code>car</code>.
</p>
<p>Four of the metrics, <code>lmg</code>, <code>pmvd</code>, <code>first</code> and <code>last</code>, 
are related to the order in which the variables are included into the model. 
For these it is possible to consider the variables in groups that are always entered into the model together. 
</p>
<p>Note that <span class="pkg">relaimpo</span> can only provide metric <code>lmg</code> for models with interactions (2-way interactions only). 
It averages only over those orders, for which the interactions enter the model after both their main effects.
</p>
<p>Note that there are different types of weights, weights indicating the variability of the response 
(observations with a more variable responses receive a lower weight than those with a less variable response,
like in the Aitken estimator), frequency weights indicating the number of observations with exactly the observed 
data pattern of the current observation, or weights indicating the number of population units represented by the 
current observation (inverse sampling probability, weights typically used in survey situations). All three types of 
weight alike can be handed to function <code>calc.relimp</code> using the <code>weights=</code> option. Note, however, that they 
have to be treated differently for bootstrapping (cf. <code>boot.relimp</code>).
</p>
<p>Data from complex surveys can be treated by providing a survey design with <code>design=</code>-option. 
For <code>calc.relimp</code>, it is also sufficient to provide the weights derived from the design using the 
<code>weights=</code>-option. 
</p>
<p><code>calc.relimp</code> cannot handle data with missing values directly. It applies complete-case analysis, 
i.e. drops all units with any missing values by default. While this can be appropriate, if there are only few 
missing values, data with more severe missingness issues need special treatment. Package <span class="pkg">relaimpo</span> 
offers the function <code>mianalyze.relimp</code> that handles multiply-imputed datasets (that can be created 
by several other <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>-packages). Currently, possibilities in this function are limited due to the fact that 
it uses complex survey designs and bootstrapping which do not (yet) go together well with factors, interactions 
and calculated quantities in formulae.

<h3>Warning </h3>

<p><code>lmg</code> and <code>pmvd</code> are computer-intensive. Although they are calculated based on the 
covariance matrix, which saves substantial computing time in comparison to carrying out actual regressions, 
these methods still take quite long for problems with many regressors.
</p>
<p><code>relaimpo</code> is a package for univariate linear models. 
Using <code>relaimpo</code> on objects that inherit from class <code>lm</code> but are not univariate linear model objects 
may produce nonsensical results without warning. Objects of class <code>mlm</code> or <code>glm</code> with link functions other than identity 
or family other than gaussian lead to an error message. 
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p> There are two versions of this package. The version on CRAN is globally licensed under GPL version 2 (or later). 
There is an extended version with the interesting additional metric <code>pmvd</code> that is licensed according to GPL version 2
under the geographical restriction "outside of the US" because of potential issues with US patent 6,640,204. 
This version can be obtained from Ulrike Groempings website (cf. references section). 
Whenever you load the package, a display tells you, which version you are loading. </p>
