<h2>Recalculate REDCap calculated fields</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function that recalculates every calculated field if the logic can be transcribed to R. Recall that calculated fields with smart-variables in the logic or variables in other events cannot be transcribed.
</p>
<p>The function will return the dataset and dictionary with the added recalculated variables (the name of the calculated field + '_recalc') along with a table that shows the summary of the results.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">recalculate(data, dic, event_form = NULL, exclude_recalc = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame containing data from REDCap.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dic</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame  containing the dictionary read from REDCap.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>event_form</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame  containing the correspondence of each event with each form.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>exclude_recalc</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character vector with the names of the variables that do not have to be recalculated. Might be useful for projects were there are some calculated fields that have a time consuming recalculation.</p>
