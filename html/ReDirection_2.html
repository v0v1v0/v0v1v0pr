<h2>check_matrix()</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function of the package 'ReDirection' checks whether the user-defined
stoichiometry matrix is suitable for further processing.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">check_matrix(input_mat, rxy)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>input_mat</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the user-defined stoichiometry matrix of a generic
metabolic network and is a mandatory argument.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rxy</code></td>
<td>
<p>A mandatory logical argument that indicates the orientation of
reactions as rows (TRUE) or columns (FALSE) of the user-defined stoichiometry
matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>'ReDirection', is reaction-centric. This means that the computations and results
are solely based on the reactions. The number of unique reactions must exceed
the number of reactants (reactions &gt;= reactants + 2).
</p>
<p>Additionally, 'ReDirection' must know if the reactions are represented as
rows (TRUE) or columns (FALSE).
</p>
<p>'ReDirection', also checks for linear dependence (rows, columns) and removes
the same. This can perturb the indices of the matrix and users are advised to
check the input stoichiometry matrix a priori.
</p>
<p>The checked and modified matrix is returned and processed further.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>output_mat A checked and modified version of the stoichiometry matrix
which is returned for further computations.
</p>
<p>flag An indicator of the suitability of the user-defined input
stoichiometry matrix for further computations.
