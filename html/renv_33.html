<h2>Purge packages from the cache</h2>

previously been installed in the cache has become corrupted or unusable,
and needs to be reinstalled.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>purge()</code> is an inherently destructive option. It removes packages from the
cache, and so any project which had symlinked that package into its own
project library would find that package now unavailable. These projects would
hence need to reinstall any purged packages. Take heed of this in case you're
looking to purge the cache of a package which is difficult to install, or
if the original sources for that package are no longer available!
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The set of packages removed from the renv global cache,
as a character vector of file paths.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 

# remove all versions of 'digest' from the cache
renv::purge("digest")

# remove only a particular version of 'digest' from the cache
renv::purge("digest", version = "0.6.19")


## End(Not run)
</code></pre>
