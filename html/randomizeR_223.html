<h2>Assessment criteria for clinical trials</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Summarizes the criteria for the assessment of randomization procedures.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Randomization in clinical trials is supposed to 
control certain properties in clinical trials. In the randomizeR package, 
these properties are called <code>issues</code>.
It is crucial to decide which of the issues is relevant in the present 
clinical trial, because a randomization procedure that manages well one issue
might behave very badly for another. The issues include
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>Selection bias</strong> 
can occur if future treatment allocations are predictable due to 
restricted randomization and unmasking of past treatment assignments.
The influence of selection bias on the test decision is represented by 
the <code>selBias</code> class. The measure for the predictability of
a randomization procedure is implemented in the <code>corGuess</code> class
representing the expected number of correct guesses.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Chronological bias</strong> 
can occur if a time trend is present in the data. Time trends occur
due to learning curves, relaxed inclusion/ exclusion criteria or
new co-medication.
Chronological bias is represented by the <code>chronBias</code> class.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Additive combination of chronological and selection bias</strong> 
may occur if a time trend and selection bias are present in the data.
The combined bias is represented by the <code>combineBias</code> class.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Balance</strong>
is important in order to ensure proper power estimation properties of
the treatments.
However, a high degree of balance favors selection bias. Depending on the
clinical context, a randomization procedure should be chosen that admits 
a suitable imbalance.
Imbalance bias is represented by the <code>imbal</code> class. The power
loss due to imbalance can be assessed directly via the <code>setPower</code>
class
</p>
</li>
</ul>
