<h2>Flow Spaghetti Plot</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>rvn_flow_spaghetti creates a spaghetti plot of the flow series provided.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rvn_flow_spaghetti(flow)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>flow</code></td>
<td>
<p>time series object of simulated flows</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Creates a spaghetti plot of the annual flow series in each
year of data provided. The flows are plotted for each water year of data
available, set as October 1st.
</p>
<p>Note that the plotting to the day of year is approximate in order to
simplify the plotting of leap years and non-leap years. The years are
plotted including day 366 and starting on day 274, regardless of whether it
is a leap year or not. This is likely without consequence in seeing the
trends between water years, however the user is warned of this deficiency.
</p>
<p>The flow series provided should be of time series (xts) format.
</p>
<p>Note that a plot title is purposely omitted in order to allow the automatic
generation of plot titles.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>TRUE</code></td>
<td>
<p>return <code>TRUE</code> if the function is executed properly</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>rvn_flow_scatterplot</code> to create a scatterplot of flow
values

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# load sample hydrograph data, two years worth of sim/obs
data(rvn_hydrograph_data)

# create spaghetti plot of simulated flows
rvn_flow_spaghetti(rvn_hydrograph_data$hyd$Sub36)

# create spaghetti plot of observed flows
rvn_flow_spaghetti(rvn_hydrograph_data$hyd$Sub36_obs)
