<h2>Changes Made to Package RcppHMM</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This page contains a listing of recent changes made to the package.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>


<ol>
<li>
<p> More examples were added to some functions. (November 2017)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Since there are different classes of HMMs and each of them with the same algorithms, a verification step was added to avoid memory leaks and variable compatibility. (May 2017)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The class of HMM with observations being modelled by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GHMM) was updated to have also a multivariate version (see <code>initGHMM</code>). (July 2017)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The emission matrix of the GHMM model was divided into two parameters: Mu and Sigma. Mu is now a 2D matrix with number of rows equal to the dimensionality of the observation vector and the number of columns equal to the number of hidden states. Sigma is now a 3D matrix with number of rows and columns equal to the the dimensionality of the observation vector and the number of slices equal to the number of hidden states (see <code>initGHMM</code>).
