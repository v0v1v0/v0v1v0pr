<h2>The effect of salt on ice melting</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>When salt comes into contact with ice, it tends to break apart into
</p>
<p>individual ions which then interact with the frozen water and disrupt
</p>
<p>hydrogen bonds that have formed between ice molecules.  This lowers the
</p>
<p>melting temperature of ice, and it was hypothesized that the melting
</p>
<p>process would be hastened.  The data set <code>salt</code> was collected
</p>
<p>during an experiment to determine whether varying the type and amount
</p>
<p>of salt applied to a specific amount of ice has an effect on the
</p>
<p>interval required to melt that ice.
</p>

<p>Background: The Effect of Salt on the Rate at Which Ice Melts
</p>
<p>In those sections of the country that experience winter as a time of
</p>
<p>snow and ice, salt is often spread on roadways in an attempt to counter
</p>
<p>the hazardous consequences of accumulated ice.  Ice is formed when the
</p>
<p>relatively disordered molecules in liquid water reach a temperature of
</p>
<p>32 degrees F (0 degrees C) and begin to "nucleate" or form solid ice
</p>
<p>crystals consisting of ordered water molecules.  Salt, when in contact
</p>
<p>with ice, tends to break apart into individual ions (i.e. sodium and
</p>
<p>chloride) which then interact with the water and disrupt the hydrogen
</p>
<p>bonds that have formed between water molecules.  Since no covalent bonds
</p>
<p>are broken or formed, the resulting chemical "solvation" is not
</p>
<p>considered to be a chemical reaction.  However, the end result from the
</p>
<p>introduction of salt is that the ice crystals are disrupted and liquid
</p>
<p>water is achieved.
</p>
<p>The purpose of the current experiment is to study the effect of salt on
</p>
<p>the rate at which ice melts.  More specifically, the experiment is being
</p>
<p>conducted to answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>1. Does varying the amount of salt applied to a constant quantity of ice
</p>
<p>result in a change in the rate of melting?
</p>
<p>2. Does the type of salt used have an effect on the melting rate?
</p>
<p>The first question is of interest as it relates to issues such as the
</p>
<p>cost of salt and the potential harmful effects of its use on pavement.
</p>
<p>If increasing the amount of salt applied to a given quantity of ice is
</p>
<p>not accompanied by an increase in melting rate, any application of salt
</p>
<p>beyond minimal amounts would constitute a waste of public money and
</p>
<p>possibly cause unnecessary damage to public roadways.  It is
</p>
<p>hypothesized that the relationship between amount of salt used and the
</p>
<p>time required to completely melt a given quantity of ice is negative and
</p>
<p>significant.
</p>
<p>Likewise, the second question seeks to address the possibility that
</p>
<p>dissimilar forms of salt may produce different rates of melting.  To
</p>
<p>answer this question, table salt and rock salt were included in the
</p>
<p>experimental design.  Although both are chemically similar, rock salt
</p>
<p>consists of larger crystals than does the typical table salt bought in
</p>
<p>local supermarkets.  Given the greater density and more efficient
</p>
<p>packing of NaCl molecules within the larger rock salt crystals, a
</p>
<p>specified volume of rock salt will likely contain a greater number of
</p>
<p>salt molecules than a similar volume of the less tightly packed table
</p>
<p>salt crystals.  Therefor, it is hypothesized that rock salt will result
</p>
<p>in faster melting times than table salt.
</p>
<p>Materials
</p>
<p>Tap water
</p>
<p>42 - 6 ounce plastic cups (paper cups tend to break at the seam as the
</p>
<p>contents freeze)
</p>
<p>Morton brand table salt
</p>
<p>Morton brand rock salt
</p>
<p>1/2 cup measure
</p>
<p>Stop Watch
</p>
<p>Procedure
</p>
<p>To answer the questions posed above, a balanced 2 x 4 factorial design
</p>
<p>was employed with amount of salt identified as a factor consisting of
</p>
<p>four levels (i.e. no salt, 1/2 tsp, 1 tsp, 1 tbsp), and the other factor
</p>
<p>being type of salt with two levels (i.e. table salt, rock salt).  Three
</p>
<p>replications were conducted within each cell for a total of 24 runs.  A
</p>
<p>p-level of .05 was identified for statistical significance prior to the
</p>
<p>data collection phase of the project.
</p>
<p>Twenty-four small plastic cups were each labeled with a number
</p>
<p>designating type of salt, and a letter A-D indicating amount of salt.
</p>
<p>Each plastic cup was then filled with 4 ounces of tap water and placed
</p>
<p>in the freezer overnight (approximately 16 hours).
</p>
<p>Since salt could not be emptied into all of the ice cups
</p>
<p>simultaneously, the remaining 18 plastic cups were each labeled and then
</p>
<p>used to hold an amount and type of salt corresponding to one of the
</p>
<p>experimental conditions.  After the ice cups had been removed from the
</p>
<p>freezer, each salt cup was quickly emptied into a corresponding ice cup
</p>
<p>with matching identification so as to minimize the time interval between
</p>
<p>the application of salt to the first and last cups.
</p>
<p>After the last cup of salt had been emptied into the appropriate ice
</p>
<p>cup, the stopwatch was started.  Room temperature during the data
</p>
<p>collection phase was approximately 72 degrees Fahrenheit.  The time was
</p>
<p>recorded for each cup when ice was no longer visible in that cup.
