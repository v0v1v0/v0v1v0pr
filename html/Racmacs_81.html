<h2>Perform a bootstrap on a map</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes the map and original titer table, and performs a version
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)">bootstrapping</a>
defined by the method argument. For each bootstrap run
this process is performed and a record of the coordinates of points in the
lowest stress solution is kept. See details for a description of the bootstrapping
methods you can apply.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bootstrapMap(
  map,
  method,
  bootstrap_repeats = 1000,
  bootstrap_ags = TRUE,
  bootstrap_sr = TRUE,
  reoptimize = TRUE,
  optimizations_per_repeat = 100,
  ag_noise_sd = 0.7,
  titer_noise_sd = 0.7,
  options = list()
)
</code></pre>

<h4>Bootstrapping methods</h4>

<p><strong>"resample"</strong>:
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)#Case_resampling">resample bootstrap</a>
is the most standard bootstrap method, a random resample of the titer table data is
taken <em>with replacement</em>. Depending on your specification, resampling is applied across
either individual antigens, individual sera or both antigens and sera.
In essence this method tries to let you see how robust the map is to inclusion of
particular titer measurements or antigens or sera. Like most bootstrapping techniques it
will prove give more reliable results the more antigens and sera you have in your map. It
won't work very well for a map of 5 sera and antigens for example, in this case a "noisy"
bootstrap may be better.
</p>
<p><strong>"bayesian"</strong>:
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)#Bayesian_bootstrap">bayesian bootstrap</a>
is akin to the resampling bootstrap, but rather than explicitly resampling data, weights are
assigned to each part of the titer table data according to random draws from a dirichilet distribution.
Under this scheme, every data point will play at least some role in making the map, even if only
weighted slightly. Sometimes this is helpful, if you know for example that the points in your map
are highly dependent upon the presence of a few antigens / sera / titers to achieve reasonable
triangulation of point positions and you don't really want to risk removing them completely and
ending up with bootstrap runs that are under-constrained, you might want to consider this approach.
On the other hand this might be exactly what you don't want and you want to know uncertainty that
can be generated when certain subsets of the data are excluded completely, in that case you probably
want to stick with the "resample" method.
</p>
<p><strong>"noisy"</strong>:
The noisy bootstrap, sometimes termed a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)#Smooth_bootstrap">smooth bootstrap</a>
involved adding normally distributed noise to each observation. The distribution of this noise can
be parameterised through the <code>ag_noise_sd</code> and <code>titer_noise_sd</code> arguments. <code>titer_noise_sd</code> refers to the
standard deviation (on the log scale) of noise added to each individual titer measurement in the table,
while <code>antigen_noise_sd</code> refers to the standard deviation of noise applied to titers for each antigen.
The reason for this distinction is that we have noticed with repeat measurements of influenza data there
is often both a random noise per titer and a random noise per antigen, i.e. in one repeat titers may all
be around one 2-fold higher on average, in addition to unbiased additional titer noise. If you wish to only
simulate additional noise per titer and not a per antigen effect, simply set <code>antigen_noise_sd</code> to 0. Note
that in order to use this most effectively it is best to have an idea of the amount and type of measurement
noise you may expect in your data and set these parameters accordingly.
