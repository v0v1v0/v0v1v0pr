<h2>REN: Regularization Ensemble for Robust Portfolio Optimization</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Portfolio optimization is achieved through a combination of regularization techniques and ensemble methods that are designed to generate stable out-of-sample return predictions, particularly in the presence of strong correlations among assets. The package includes functions for data preparation, parallel processing, and portfolio analysis using methods such as Mean-Variance, James-Stein, LASSO, Ridge Regression, and Equal Weighting. It also provides visualization tools and performance metrics, such as the Sharpe ratio, volatility, and maximum drawdown, to assess the results.
