<h2> Tree abundance in tropical montane forest plots </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> Tree abundance in 224 0.1-ha plots in three montane cloud forest regions of Chiapas, Mexico. </p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> data(Chiapas) </code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p> The <code>Chiapas</code> data set contains data for 375 tree species (columns) from 224 0.1-ha plots (rows). The first column is a factor with three levels with the name of the region.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This data set characterizes tree communities from tropical montane cloud forests in three regions of the state of Chiapas, Mexico: El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve in Sierra Madre (100 plots), the Highlands (38 plots), and the Northern Mountains (86 plots). For these plots, incidence records were based on trees exceeding 5 cm in diameter at breast height. Data were obtained from the BIOTREE-NET website (www.biotreenet.com). Species names were standardized and typographical errors were corrected using The Plant List through the <span class="pkg">Taxostand</span> package (Cayuela et al. 2012). Distance between regions ranged from ca. 50 kms (the Highlands and Northern Mountains) to ca. 250 kms (El Triunfo and Northern Mountains).
