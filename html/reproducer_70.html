<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data is used in the paper: Barbara Kitchenham, Lech Madeyski and Pearl Brereton. Meta-analysis for Families of Experiments: A Systematic Review and Reproducibility Assessment, Empirical Software Engineering (2019) doi:10.1007/s10664-019-09747-0.
This file holds the individual effect sizes for each experiment, as reported by 13 primary studies in the systematic review.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A text file with variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Study</dt>
<dd>
<p>This field includes the study identifier of each of the 13 primary studies which were included in the systematic review.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Type</dt>
<dd>
<p>This identifies the type of effect size used by the study authors. d  or g refer to dIG and gIG, p is the p-value used for aggregation, if the repeated measures estimate was obtained it is appropriately specified as gRM, r refers to the point bi-serial correlation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>
<p>Always set to Rep. This identifies that the data was as reported by the primary study authors.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Design</dt>
<dd>
<p>The refers to the design method used by the study author. 4GroupCO is a 4-group crossover design. Mixed means different experiments in a particular family used different methods (only S3 used mixed methods and 4 experiments used the 4 group crossover and one used an independent groups design). ABBACO is the standard 2-group crossover design. IndGroups is the independent groups design also called between groups design or a randomised design. PrePost is pretest and posttest design with a post test control.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Exp1</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the reported standardized effect size for the first experiment in the family.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Exp2</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the reported standardized effect size for the second experiment in the family.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Exp3</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the reported standardized effect size for the third experiment in the family.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Exp4</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the reported standardized effect size for the fourth experiment in the family. NA means there was no fourth experiment in the family.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Exp5</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the reported standardized effect size for the fifth experiment in the family. NA means there was no fifth experiment in the family.</p>
</dd>
