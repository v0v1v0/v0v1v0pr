<h2>Interpolate the Inclusion of the Other in the Self Scale</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Interpolating the Inclusion of the Other in
the Self Scale (IOS; self-other merging) easily. The user provides
the IOS score, from 1 to 7, and the function will provide a
percentage of actual area overlap between the two circles
(i.e., not linear overlap), so it is possible to say, e.g.,
that experimental group 1 had an average overlap of X%
with the other person, whereas experimental group 2 had
an average overlap of X% with the other person.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">overlap_circle(response, categories = c("Self", "Other"), scoring = "IOS")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>response</code></td>
<td>
<p>The variable to plot: requires IOS scores ranging
from 1 to 7 (when <code>scoring = "IOS"</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>categories</code></td>
<td>
<p>The desired category names of the two overlapping
circles for display on the plot.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scoring</code></td>
<td>
<p>One of <code>c("IOS", "percentage", "direct")</code>. If
<code>scoring = "IOS"</code>, response needs to be a value between 1 to 7.
If set to <code>"percentage"</code> or <code>"direct"</code>, responses need to be
between 0 and 100. If set to <code>"direct"</code>, must provide exactly
three values that represent the area from the first circle,
the middle overlapping area, and area from the second circle.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The circles are generated through the
<code>VennDiagram::draw.pairwise.venn()</code> function and the desired
percentage overlap is passed to its <code>cross.area</code> argument
("The size of the intersection between the sets"). The percentage
overlap values are interpolated from this reference grid:
Score of 1 = 0%, 2 = 10%, 3 = 20%, 4 = 30%, 5 = 55%, 6 = 65%,
7 = 85%.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A plot of class gList, displaying overlapping circles relative
to the selected score.

Other in the Self (IOS) task (instead of the pen and paper version), for

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# Score of 1 (0% overlap)
overlap_circle(1)

# Score of 3.5 (25% overlap)
overlap_circle(3.5)

# Score of 6.84 (81.8% overlap)
overlap_circle(6.84)

# Changing labels
overlap_circle(3.12, categories = c("Humans", "Animals"))


# Saving to file (PDF or PNG)
plot &lt;- overlap_circle(3.5)
ggplot2::ggsave(plot,
  file = tempfile(fileext = ".pdf"), width = 7,
  height = 7, unit = "in", dpi = 300
)
# Change for your own desired path
