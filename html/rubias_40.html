<h2>From the pattern of missing data at each individual, compute the expected mean and variance of the logl</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This takes a param_list so that it has access to individual genotypes (and hence can cycle through them
and know which are missing and which are not.)  It also takes a matrix of per-locus logl means
and variances like what is computed by <code>per_locus_means_and_vars</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rcpp_indiv_specific_logl_means_and_vars(par_list, MV)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>par_list</code></td>
<td>
<p>genetic data converted to the param_list format by <code>tcf2param_list</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>MV</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of two matrices, one of means and the other of variances, which are C x L
matrices.  This is basically the list that is returned by <code>per_locus_means_and_vars</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function doesn't do any checking to assure that the par_list and the per-locus logl means
matrix are made for one another.  (i.e. use the same collections in the same order.)
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a matrix with C rows and I columns. Each row
represents a collection, and each column an individual.
