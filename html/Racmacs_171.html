<h2>Set acmap merge options</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function facilitates setting options for the acmap titer merging process by
returning a list of option settings.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">RacMerge.options(sd_limit = NULL, dilution_stepsize = 1, method = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sd_limit</code></td>
<td>
<p>When merging titers, titers that have a standard deviation of
this amount or greater on the log2 scale will be set to "*" and excluded.
Setting this to NA removes any limit. The default value will be NA, unless
the titer merge method is specified as "lispmds" in which case the default
is 1 and standard deviation is calculated by division by n, instead of n-1,
in order to maintain backwards compatibility with previous approaches.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dilution_stepsize</code></td>
<td>
<p>The dilution stepsize to assume when merging titers (see
<code>dilutionStepsize()</code>)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>The titer merging method to use, either a string of "conservative" or "likelihood", or a user defined function. See details.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When merging measured titers, the general approach is to take the geometric
mean and use that as the merged titer, however in particular when &lt; values
are present there are different options that can be employed. In older
versions of Racmacs, &lt; values were converted to maximum possible numeric
titer after accounting for the dilution_stepsize factor, then the geometric
mean was taken. This approach can be used by specifying the method as
"likelihood" since, this approach gives a very rough approximation of the
most likely mean numeric value. In contrast, the "conservative" method and
current default returns the highest &lt; value that satisfies all the values
that were measured. As an example merging &lt;10 and 20, (assuming
dilution_stepsize = 1) would return a value of 10 with the "likelihood"
method and &lt;40 with the "conservative" method.
