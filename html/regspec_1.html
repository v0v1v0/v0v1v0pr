<h2>
Non-parametric multirate spectral density estimation via linear Bayes.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Estimate a spectral density function of a stationary time
series. Produces a linear Bayes estimate with credible intervals.
Can incorporate time series data from multiple realizations with
different sampling rate. Can deal with time series data that has
been filtered with a known filter (e.g. quarterly totals from monthly
values).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Currently, the package's centrepiece is the function <code>regspec</code>, which implements spectral density estimation from time series data at integer time points.
A novel element of the code is it's ability to assimilate subsampled and filtered data.
</p>
<p>The package's data files, which will be loaded automatically, include synthetic and real examples of time series data that feature in the <code>Examples</code> sections of the functions' help files.
