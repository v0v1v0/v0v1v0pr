<h2>This is the discrete time logistic growth function known as the logistic map.  It calculates the amount of growth expected
in a step of time given by:  N_t+1 = N_t + r * (N_t (K - N_t)/K);
where N_t is community size at a time point, r is the per step growth rate, and K is the environmental carrying capacity.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is the discrete time logistic growth function known as the logistic map.  It calculates the amount of growth expected
in a step of time given by:  N_t+1 = N_t + r * (N_t (K - N_t)/K);
where N_t is community size at a time point, r is the per step growth rate, and K is the environmental carrying capacity.

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func_startPop</code></td>
<td>
<p>The initial summed size of the evolving community</p>
</td>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># This is the discrete time step form of the logistic equation, known as the logistic map.
# It takes a growth rate starting and max possible community size.
stepwise_Size &lt;- 100
for(thisStep in 1:7){
  stepwise_Size &lt;- c(stepwise_Size,
                     logisticMap(2,stepwise_Size[length(stepwise_Size)],1e4))
}
stepwise_Size
# When a population overshoots, it will loose members.
