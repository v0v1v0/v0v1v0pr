<h2>rpf - Response Probability Functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Factor out logic and math common
to Item Factor Analysis fitting, diagnostics, and analysis.  It is
envisioned as core support code suitable for more specialized IFA
packages to build upon.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package provides optimized, low-level functions to map
parameters to response probabilities for dichotomous (1PL, 2PL and
3PL) <code>rpf.drm</code> and polytomous (graded response
<code>rpf.grm</code>, partial credit/generalized partial credit
(via the nominal model), and nominal <code>rpf.nrm</code> items.
</p>
<p>Item model parameters are passed around as a numeric vector. A 1D
matrix is also acceptable. Regardless of model, parameters are
always ordered as follows: discrimination/slope ("a"),
difficulty/intercept ("b"), and pseudo guessing/upper-bound ("g"/"u"). If
person ability ranges from negative to positive then
probabilities are output from incorrect to correct. That is, a low
ability person (e.g., ability = -2) will be more likely to get an
item incorrect than correct. For example, a dichotomous model that
returns [.25, .75] indicates a probability of .25 for incorrect
and .75 for correct.  A polytomous model will have the most
incorrect probability at index 1 and the most correct probability
at the maximum index.
</p>
<p>All models are always in the logistic metric. To obtain normal
ogive discrimination parameters, divide slope parameters by
<code>rpf.ogive</code>. Item models are estimated in
slope-intercept form. Input/output matrices arranged in the way
most convenient for low-level processing in C. The maximum
absolute logit is 35 because f(x) := 1-exp(x) loses accuracy around f(-35)
and equals 1 at f(-38) due to the limited accuracy of double
precision floating point.
</p>
<p>This package could also accrete functions to support plotting (but
not the actual plot functions).
