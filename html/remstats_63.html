<h2>sp</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Specifies the statistic for a shared partners effect for undirected events.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sp(unique = FALSE, scaling = c("none", "std"), consider_type = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>unique</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value indicating whether to sum the minimum of
events with third actors (FALSE, default) or the number of third actors that
create a new, unique shared partner (TRUE). See details for more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scaling</code></td>
<td>
<p>the method for scaling the triad statistic. Default is to not
scale the statistic but keep the raw 'counts'. Alternatively,
standardization of the raw counts per time point can be requested
with 'std'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>consider_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, indicates whether to count the shared partners
separately for each event type (TRUE, default) or sum across different event
types (FALSE).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The shared partners effect describes the propensity of dyads to interact
based on the number of past shared partners between them. By default, the
statistic at timepoint t for the undirected dyad (i,j) is computed as
the sum of the minimum occurrences of past undirected (i,h) and undirected
(j,h) events across all actors h.
</p>
<p>When the unique parameter is set to TRUE, a different approach is taken.
In this case, the statistic counts the number of actors h that contribute to
the creation of a new, distinct shared partner between actors i and j.
</p>
<p>Additionally, it is possible to specify a scaling method using the scaling
parameter.
</p>
<p>Please note that the shared partners effect, 'sp', is exclusively defined
for undirected events.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>List with all information required by 'remstats::remstats()' to compute the statistic.
</p>

<code>isp</code> for triadic effects for directed relational events.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">reh_tie &lt;- remify::remify(history, model = "tie", directed = FALSE)
effects &lt;- ~ sp()
remstats(tie_effects = effects, reh = reh_tie)

</code></pre>
