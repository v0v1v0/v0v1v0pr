<h2>Create a quosure from components</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>new_quosure()</code> wraps any R object (including expressions,
formulas, or other quosures) into a quosure.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>as_quosure()</code> is similar but it does not rewrap formulas and
quosures.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">new_quosure(expr, env = caller_env())

as_quosure(x, env = NULL)

is_quosure(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>expr</code></td>
<td>
<p>An expression to wrap in a quosure.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>env</code></td>
<td>
<p>The environment in which the expression should be
evaluated. Only used for symbols and calls. This should normally
be the environment in which the expression was created.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object to test.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># `new_quosure()` creates a quosure from its components. These are
# equivalent:
new_quosure(quote(foo), current_env())

quo(foo)

# `new_quosure()` always rewraps its input into a new quosure, even
# if the input is itself a quosure:
new_quosure(quo(foo))

# This is unlike `as_quosure()` which preserves its input if it's
# already a quosure:
as_quosure(quo(foo))


# `as_quosure()` uses the supplied environment with naked expressions:
env &lt;- env(var = "thing")
as_quosure(quote(var), env)

# If the expression already carries an environment, this
# environment is preserved. This is the case for formulas and
# quosures:
as_quosure(~foo, env)

as_quosure(~foo)

# An environment must be supplied when the input is a naked
# expression:
try(
  as_quosure(quote(var))
)
