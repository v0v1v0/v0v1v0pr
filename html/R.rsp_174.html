<h2>Non-documented objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This page contains aliases for all "non-documented" objects that
<code>R CMD check</code> detects in this package.
</p>
<p>Almost all of them are <em>generic</em> functions that have specific
document for the corresponding method coupled to a specific class.
Other functions are re-defined by <code>setMethodS3()</code> to
<em>default</em> methods. Neither of these two classes are non-documented
in reality.
The rest are deprecated methods.
