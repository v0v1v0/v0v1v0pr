<h2>Package R.cache</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Memoization can be used to speed up repetitive and computational expensive function calls.  The first time a function that implements memoization is called the results are stored in a cache memory.  The next time the function is called with the same set of parameters, the results are momentarily retrieved from the cache avoiding repeating the calculations.  With this package, any R object can be cached in a key-value storage where the key can be an arbitrary set of R objects.  The cache memory is persistent (on the file system).

<h3>Wishlist</h3>

<p>Here is a list of features that would be useful, but which I have
too little time to add myself. Contributions are appreciated.
</p>

<ul><li>
<p> Add a functionality to identify cache files that are
no longer of use.  For now, there is an extra header field
for arbitrary comments which can be used, but maybe more
formal fields are useful, e.g. keywords, user, etc?
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you consider implement some of the above, make sure it is not
already implemented by downloading the latest "devel" version!
</p>
