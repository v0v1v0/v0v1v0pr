<h2>length_weight</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The LENGTH-WEIGHT table presents the a and b values of over 5,000
length-weight relationships of the form W = a x Lb, pertaining to about over 2,000 fish species.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">length_weight(
  species_list = NULL,
  fields = NULL,
  server = c("fishbase", "sealifebase"),
  version = "latest",
  db = NULL,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>species_list</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of scientific names (each element as "genus species"). If empty, a table for all fish will be returned.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fields</code></td>
<td>
<p>subset to these columns.  (recommend to omit this and handle manually)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>server</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either "fishbase" or "sealifebase".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>version</code></td>
<td>
<p>a version string for the database. See <code>available_releases()</code> for details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>db</code></td>
<td>
<p>database connection, now deprecated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>See references for official documentation.  From FishBase.org:
Length-weight relationships are important in fisheries science,
notably to raise length-frequency samples to total catch, or to
estimate biomass from underwater length observations.
The units of length and weight in FishBase are centimeter and gram, respectively.
Thus when length-weight relationships are not in cm-g, the intercept 'a'
is transformed as follows:
</p>
<p>a'(cm, g) = a (mm, g)*10^b
a'(cm, g) = a (cm, kg)*1000
a'(cm, g) = a (mm, mg)*10^b/1000
a'(cm, g) = a (mm, kg)<em>10^b</em>1000
</p>
<p>However, published length-weight relationships are sometimes difficult to use,
as they may be based on a length measurement type (e.g., fork length) different
from ones length measurements (expressed e.g., as total length).
Therefore, to facilitate conversion between length types, an additional
LENGTH-LENGTH table, #' presented below, was devised which presents linear
regressions or ratios linking length types (e.g., FL vs. TL).
We included a calculated field with the weight of a 10 cm fish (which
should be in the order of 10 g for normal, fusiform shaped fish),
to allow identification of gross errors, given knowledge of the body
form of a species.
