<h2>Package rtf</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A set of R functions to output Rich Text Format (RTF) files with high
resolution tables and graphics that may be edited with a standard word
processor such as Microsoft Word.  This is useful for compiling R
results into a document for further editing or to be merged with another
document.
</p>
<p>While Sweave and odfWeave provide nicely formatted outputs, the syntax
can be difficult for beginners to master. Moreover, Sweave compilation
to a PDF is not editable.  Other packages such as SWord and R2wd provide
similar functionality but require the user to be running a Microsoft
Windows OS.
</p>
<p>This package is written in pure R and does not require leaving the R
environment to write files. R data frames and table objects are converted to
nicely formatted RTF tables.  One important limitation of the RTF
specification is that vector graphics output is limited to Windows Meta File
(WMF) and Enhanced Meta File (EMF) formats.  Because these formats are not
supported across platforms, this package currently only supports RTF
embedding of PNG plots and images.  To ensure high quality reports, the
resolution may be specified when writing the RTF output.
