<h2>Create a new, empty rstack</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An rstack is a "Last In, First Out" (LIFO) structure imagined as being organized from
top (last in) to bottom (first in), supporting efficient insertion into the
top, removal from the top, and peeking/accessing the top element. All functions supported by rstacks are
side-effect free.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rstack()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Other handy functions supported by rstacks
include <code>as.list</code> and <code>as.data.frame</code> (the latter of which requires that
all elements can be appended to become rows of a data frame in a reasonable manner). Operations
are amortized <code class="reqn">O(1)</code>.
</p>
<p>The rstack class also supports <code>rev</code> - this operation is <code class="reqn">O(N)</code>, and results in a copy. This
means previous versions will retain their <code class="reqn">O(1)</code> amortized nature (if we assume the cost of the
reverse is charged to the newly created stack), at the cost of memory usage. However, this also means
that if stacks are used in a non-persistent way, e.g. <code>s &lt;- rev(s)</code>, then the garbage collector
is free to clean up old versions of the data.
